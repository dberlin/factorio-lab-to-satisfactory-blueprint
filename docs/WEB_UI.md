# The web UI

Paste a FactorioLab URL, set the options and press Build. Satisfactory builds
appear in 3D with `.sbp`/`.sbpcfg` downloads; DSP builds retain their copyable
blueprint strings. Both use the same game-specific pipelines as the CLI.

## Starting it

```bash
uv sync
uv run flab2bp-web          # http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

That is the whole command. On first run it builds the front end itself (`bun install
--frozen-lockfile && bun run build` in `web/`), so the prerequisites are `uv` and `bun` on
`PATH` and nothing else — `flab2bp.web` uses the standard-library HTTP server plus `httpx`
and Pydantic, which the core package already requires. There is deliberately no `[web]` extra,
because there is nothing to put in it.

| flag | what it does |
| --- | --- |
| `--port N` / `--host H` | move it (default `127.0.0.1:8000`) |
| `--build` | rebuild the TypeScript even though `web/dist` exists |
| `--no-build` | never shell out to `bun`; serve whatever `web/dist` holds |
| `--workers N` | concurrent builds. Leave it at 1 — see below |
| `--dist PATH` | serve a front end built somewhere else |

If the front end is not built and `bun` is missing, the API still serves and the page says so
in plain text rather than 404ing.

## Satisfactory builds and inspection

Entering a Satisfactory URL selects `sections`, enables automatic FactorioLab
flow capture unless a CSV is already supplied, and exposes the Blueprint Designer
mark. A supplied export disables automatic capture and pins that exact flow.
The completed build publishes its binary-derived scene automatically, without
replacing a newer manually opened blueprint. After an import, **Show completed
blueprint in 3D** restores the build result.

The viewer uses the bundled registry, not DSP assets or generated object naming
conventions. Open/drop `.sbp` files for the same inspection path. It renders
machine clearance geometry, sampled belt/pipe curves, splitter/merger attachments,
pipe junctions and pumps, lift spans/endpoints, foundations, beams, floor holes,
storage and power connections. Use layer
switches and machine ghost/solid/hidden modes, click an object or choose it in
the inspector, and follow its saved connections. Q/E rotates, O toggles top-down;
drag orbits and scroll zooms. Building counts and header construction materials
are available in the expandable list.

This is schematic visualization, not game meshes or a paste certification.
Unknown objects stay visible as diagnostic markers. Unresolved connections,
partial lift envelopes, unextracted floor-hole cap meshes and conservative
shear bounds have explicit notices. Full actor quaternions are retained,
including the pitched junctions, pumps and beams used by vertical trunks.

Generated `.sbpcfg` descriptions include net bottom-input/top-output rates,
machine clocks, recipes, estimated production power, boost consumables and
startup instructions. Keep repeated modules at matching XY/orientation and
the stated vertical pitch; manually bridge corresponding holes across the
4 m seam. Inputs branch locally and continue upward. Size supply and drainage
for every copy within the reported trunk capacities, power the pumps, and
provide each liquid inlet's reported head above its bottom port. That obligation
comes from the routed geometry; the blueprint cannot measure world pressure.
Verified icon/color defaults are preserved; the filename supplies the game name.

## DSP strategy choices

The strategy choices are `best`, `freeform`, `sequence-pair`, `transport-routing`,
and `hierarchical`. `best` automatically runs Freeform, SequencePair,
CaDiCaL-based transport-routing and hierarchical, then selects the smallest
validator-clean result. It is a portfolio, not first-finisher-wins.

The solver-work ceiling is `candidates × active production strategies × budget` for `best`,
using the pipeline's canonical four-strategy tuple. One build defaults to an aggregate
budget of at most 16 CPUs from its process affinity set. The widest candidate batch runs
whose shares can fund all four strategies. Each candidate gives hierarchical one quarter
of its share (rounded down, with at least one worker). Of the remaining share, Freeform
gets three quarters rounded down minus one (at least one); transport-routing gets one;
SequencePair gets the remainder. A single 16-worker candidate starts at 8/3/1/4 workers
in portfolio order; three candidates share 6/5/5 workers, funding 2/1/1 SequencePair islands.
If machine-group count already guarantees at least 15 strips, Freeform's deterministic
packing can use only one worker. Its unused share moves to hierarchy, giving 1/3/1/11
at 16 total or 1/6/1/24 at 32. This does not change the aggregate budget or island count.
If even one four-worker portfolio cannot fit, the strategies run serially within the
aggregate worker budget instead. Only explicitly selected hierarchical may size its
pool from uncapped CPU affinity when no worker count is supplied.
Uploaded or fetched flows remain a single pinned candidate. Explicit strategies run
serially across candidates. Transport-routing owns a supervised single worker and supports
unsprayed and sprayed interfaces; every portfolio strategy faces the same certification.
Completed race children perform the same full validation before returning their result.
The parent reuses a judgment only for its exact placement, complete request and belt
rules; otherwise it validates again. Encoding still runs for every retained alternative.

## Latitude bands

The selector defaults to **Portable (smallest + up to two wider)**. The request field is the string
`band`, and its complete shared Python/TypeScript enum is:

```text
portable | 4 | 8 | 16 | 20 | 32 | 40 | 60 | 80 | 100 | 120 | 160 | 200
```

Portable finds the globally smallest band in which the unpadded content fits (`B0`) and
certifies `B0` plus up to two bands with greater `area_segments`. The same frame must pass at
every legal latitude anchor in each required band. Near the equator only one or two bands may
remain, so `certified_bands` reports the literal set checked; Portable is not a promise about
every planetary band.

The frame search may add zero through four empty latitude rows, distributed between its north
and south margins, without changing `B0`. It never pads longitude. If none of those frames
passes, the build is refused instead of silently falling back to a single band.

Selecting a number is explicit-only: `200`, for example, certifies only band 200 with the same
up-to-four-row latitude-padding search. A frame that does not fit the requested band or fails at
any legal anchor refuses. Successful results display `primary_band` and exact
`certified_bands`; projection refusals retain the band, check, building indices, and detail for
each distinct projection failure.

## Proving it works

```bash
uv run scripts/web_smoke.py --out out/web-smoke
```

This is the check, not a demo. It starts a server on a free port, drives a real Chromium
through `nodriver`, types the URL, sets the options, presses Build, waits for the job, presses
**Copy blueprint string**, reads the clipboard back, and then **decodes that exact string with
`flab2bp.dsp.codec.decode`** and asserts `encode(decode(x)) == x` byte for byte. It screenshots
the 3D canvas through CDP and counts distinct colours, because a WebGL surface that never drew
is one flat colour and one flat colour is exactly 1. It then runs a spec the layout model
refuses and checks the reason reaches the page, and a third that pastes a FactorioLab flow
export and checks the report comes back **pinned** rather than derived. Two screenshots and a
`report.json` land in `--out`; it exits non-zero on the first thing that does not hold.


`nodriver` rather than Playwright for the same reason `flab2bp.lab.capture` uses it: Playwright
ships its own browser builds and none work on Fedora, so a proof driven through it is a proof
this machine cannot re-run.

`nodriver` is intentionally pinned to 0.47.0, the newest verified release whose Python source
is importable. The pin remains until a newer importable release is verified.

## What the page shows

The blueprint's own **title** names the *product*, `space-warper 10/min (max prolif)`,
not the candidate that won. Auto-generated titles are capped at 60 C# UTF-16 code units,
matching Dyson Sphere Program's save check. If the composed title is too long, the second
displayed product is shortened to uppercase initials first, then the first product; numeric
hyphen-delimited tokens remain whole. Rates, output order, `+N more`, and the policy suffix
stay unchanged whenever initials are enough. If they are not, the whole title is truncated
at a valid UTF-16 boundary and ends in one `…`.

The web **Name** input has the same 60-character browser limit. The page then shows the title,
machine count, tile count, building count, which strategy and candidate produced it, what it
makes and what has to be belted in.

Then the parts that read as silence if nobody prints them:

* **Whether the belt ceiling was read or assumed.** A URL with no technology set gets a
  fully-researched save assumed, and the page says so in a warning box. That claim is very
  different from "the URL told us", and only one of them is safe to build against.
* **Whether the recipe selection was pinned or re-derived.** Re-derived unless a flow export
  was supplied, and the page says which.
* **Validator warnings.** A warning means a check *ran* and found something to look at — a belt
  run nothing taps, or one item arriving through multiple external-entry lanes. The latter
  remains valid and does not block emission, but the player must connect every lane; latitude
  certification does not change `flow.external_entry_points`.
* **Every strategy/candidate pair that produced no layout**, with its reason — invisible in the
  attempts table, and silence there reads as "it simply was not the best".

## Progress is real, and where it is not

`pipeline.build` takes an `on_progress` sink and calls it as each (candidate, strategy) pair
starts and as it settles, so the bar counts **pairs finished over pairs to do**. Unpinned
`best` web requests may have several candidate portfolios active at once; the line above the
bar therefore names the most recently reported pair, while `settled` retains every completed
pair. `GET /api/build/<id>` carries both fields.

Before layout there is nothing to count: parsing the URL and solving the rates take an unknown
time and are not divided into pairs. The panel says exactly that and falls back to elapsed time
against `solver_ceiling_s` — `candidates × strategies × budget`. This is an aggregate
solver-work/admission bound, not a wall-clock prediction: bounded candidate concurrency can
spend several budgets simultaneously, and validation and encoding are on top.

## Flow provenance

Paste FactorioLab's CSV export into the flow box, or choose the file, to pin recipe selection.
The API takes it as text and sends it through `flow_from_text` and its provenance check exactly
as a file named on the command line does. An export generated from a *different* URL is refused
with the difference spelled out parameter by parameter; it is never quietly ignored.

The **Fetch FactorioLab flow automatically** checkbox is initially unchecked. Selecting it
launches the server's installed Chromium, waits for FactorioLab to solve, and exports the flow.
Automatic capture is allowed only for HTTPS pages on `factoriolab.github.io` at `/dsp/list` or
`/dsp/flow`, with no nonstandard port; the final page after navigation must remain on that
allowlist too. Pasted/uploaded flow and automatic fetch are mutually exclusive in web requests,
and the controls disable reciprocally. If capture fails, the build is refused rather than
silently falling back to re-derived recipes.

Without pasted or captured flow, a build reports `flow_pinned: false` — the recipe selection is
DERIVED, not FactorioLab's own. That is the weaker guarantee, and the page says so.

## What it does NOT do

**A job does not survive a restart.** The registry is a dict in the server process and the
queue is a `ThreadPoolExecutor`. Restarting `flab2bp-web` abandons every in-flight solve and
every finished result. For one person on localhost that is the right trade; anything
longer-lived wants the job state somewhere it can be re-read, and that is a different program.

**A running solve cannot be cancelled.** "Stop watching" stops the polling, not the solve:
CP-SAT holds its worker until its budget expires. The button is named for what it actually does,
which is the honest half. The fix is not in this package at all — it needs a `SolutionCallback`
or a solve interrupter threaded through the layout backends that build and run a `CpSolver`.
It is the one item on this list that is unfinished rather than decided.

**Jobs queue; one job's candidate portfolio may run in bounded parallel.** The default
one-job queue prevents two users from each claiming a solver budget. Inside that job, the
pipeline uses at most 16 available CPUs by default and divides them across concurrent
candidate portfolios. Each allocates a quarter share to hierarchical, reserves one worker
for transport-routing, and divides the remaining workers between Freeform and SequencePair
as described under Strategy choices. Candidate concurrency narrows to fund at least four
workers per portfolio; underfunded portfolios run serially. `--workers` above 1 still permits concurrent jobs and can
make every build slower because
`time_budget_s` is wall-clock. There is no admission control at all beyond the queue: the
budget has no upper bound, and a projected total over 300s is warned about rather than
refused.

**A refusal leaves the previous blueprint on screen, and now says so.** The viewer keeps
rendering whatever was loaded last, because clearing it would throw away the thing you were
looking at. What used to be wrong was the label: the toolbar went on naming a build a refusal
had superseded. It now reads *previous build — the last one produced no blueprint* whenever the
canvas is not the outcome of the last build, which covers a refusal, an error, and a build whose
string was withheld for failing validation.

**`/api/fetch` is a relay, and it no longer relays into this machine.** Inherited from the
viewer's `src/server/proxy.ts`, which followed redirects blind — so an allowed public URL could
answer `302 Location: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/build` and be fetched, which is the entire
redirect-based SSRF. Redirects are now followed by hand and every hop is resolved and rejected
if it lands on a loopback, private, link-local or reserved address; all of a name's addresses
are checked, not just the first.

It is deliberately **not** offered as a complete defence: the address is resolved in
`private_address` and connected to by httpx a moment later, so a DNS entry that changes between
the two still gets through. Closing that needs a transport pinned to the address it checked.
What is closed is the redirect hop, which needed no race at all. Anything public still needs
rate limiting on `/api/build` before it goes anywhere.

**`web/node_modules` is not committed.** It was, on master, and it was *broken*: the root
`.gitignore`'s unanchored `dist/` pattern stripped every package's `dist/` directory on the way
in, so a fresh clone got a node_modules complete enough that `bun install --frozen-lockfile`
reported "no changes" and incomplete enough that `bun run build` died on
`Cannot find module '@rsbuild/core/dist/index.js'`. `web/.gitignore` already said
`node_modules/`; this branch makes that true. `bun.lock` is the declaration.


## The API

```
POST /api/build          submit; 202 with an id, or 400 with a reason
GET  /api/build/<id>     poll; state, progress, and the result when there is one
GET  /api/build/<id>/artifacts/<name>  download a retained .sbp or .sbpcfg
GET  /api/build/<id>/scene             decode the retained Satisfactory artifact
POST /api/sfy/scene?name=<filename>    import raw .sbp bytes for visualization
GET  /api/health         is the server up, and is the front end built
GET  /api/fetch?url=...  the viewer's own blueprint-page proxy
GET  /*                  the built front end, with an SPA fallback
```

Scene uploads are bounded to 16 MiB compressed, 64 MiB actually decompressed,
25,000 decoded objects and 500,000 sampled points. Invalid binaries return 422;
resource-limit violations return 413. The decoder bounds serialized array
counts as well as compressed bytes. No upload filename becomes a server path.
Satisfactory builds use `strategy: "sections"` and `designer: "mk1" | "mk2" | "mk3"`;
the options and portfolio details below describe the inherited DSP build path.

The submit body takes `url`, `strategy` (`best`/`freeform`/`sequence-pair`/`transport-routing`/`hierarchical`), `candidates`
(1–8), positive finite `budget_s`, `band`
(`portable`/`4`/`8`/`16`/`20`/`32`/`40`/`60`/`80`/`100`/`120`/`160`/`200`),
`name`, `allow_invalid`, `flow`, and `fetch_flow`. `band` defaults to `portable`.
Power is always enabled: every web build includes Tesla Towers, and the page has no power
selector. The retired `power` request key is rejected rather than ignored.
`flow` is a FactorioLab CSV export as text, while `fetch_flow: true` asks the server to capture
one from an allowlisted FactorioLab page; the two are mutually exclusive. A poll echoes
`flow_supplied` rather than the CSV itself (it can be hundreds of kB and the page already has
it); `result.flow_pinned` is the proof it was honoured. A successful `result` also carries
`primary_band` and literal `certified_bands`. Every bound is a refusal rather than a clamp,
never silently rounded down to something servable, because running a different build from the
one that was asked for and reporting it as the one that was asked for is the failure mode this
whole project exists to avoid.

`budget_s` is the one field with no upper bound, for that same reason: how long to search is
the caller's call. It must be positive and finite, and that is all. A job whose projected
total — `candidates × strategies × (budget + completion grace)` — exceeds 300s is accepted
with a `warning` string on the job snapshot spelling out the arithmetic; `warning` is `null`
otherwise. The page shows the same sum next to the budget box before you submit, and the
Build button stays enabled: it is a warning, not a gate.

`blueprint` is `null` when validation failed and `allow_invalid` was not set — the same refusal
the CLI makes without `--allow-invalid`, moved to the place the string would be copied from.
The page then offers a button that says what you would be asking for.

A refused job's `refusal.attempts` preserves a tree of actual solver outcomes. Each entry
contains `candidate`, `strategy`, `reason`, `stats`, `projection_failures`, and `children`;
`children` is always an array and is empty for a leaf. Sequence-island children retain their
own `sequence-pair/island-<id>` identity, seed, observed stages, and projection evidence instead
of merging counters from different islands. Unobserved non-finite numeric statistics are
serialized as `null`, never as zero. A routing-clock refusal means work was unfinished, not
that the requested geometry has been proved impossible.

## Working on the TypeScript

```bash
cd web && bun run dev      # rsbuild on 3001, /api proxied to flab2bp-web on 8000
```

The solver is Python, so `flab2bp-web` has to be running either way. `web/` is the former
`dsp-blueprint-viewer` — React, rsbuild, three.js — taken in-tree and taken over rather than
vendored, and its own gates still apply:

```bash
cd web && bun run typecheck && bun run lint && bun run test
```
