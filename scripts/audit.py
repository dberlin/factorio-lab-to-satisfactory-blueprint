Exits non-zero if any cell is not clean, so it works as a gate.

WHY THIS IS A SCRIPT AND NOT A TEST
-----------------------------------
The whole matrix is minutes of CP-SAT and the test suite is deliberately ~24s.
Putting this in ``pytest`` would either make the suite unusable in an edit loop
or force it down to a sample so small it stops being the guarantee it exists to
be.  It is the gate you run before believing "both strategies work".

WHAT COUNTS AS A FAILURE, AND WHY THE DISTINCTION MATTERS
--------------------------------------------------------
Four ways a cell can miss, and they call for opposite fixes:

* ``REFUSED`` -- the strategy searched and raised ``NoValidLayout``.  Honest, and
  the *better* failure: nothing broken is emitted.
* ``INVALID`` -- it produced a placement the validator rejected.  Worse than
  refusing, because a blueprint that pastes and then does not run is the one
  outcome nobody discovers until they are standing in front of it in game.
* ``CRASH`` -- an unexpected exception.  Always a bug here, never the spec's
  fault.
* ``NOT RUN`` -- the wall-clock cap expired first.  Not a verdict on the cell;
  a verdict on this run.  Counted as a failure so a truncated audit can never
  be mistaken for a clean one.

A budget sweep is not optional padding.  CP-SAT is time-limited and multi-worker
by default, so a spec that validates at 4s may not at 1s, and "clean" that only
holds at one budget is not clean.  A LOW budget producing INVALID rather than
REFUSED is a serious finding: it means the feasibility check is budget-dependent
somewhere it should not be.

WHY THIS RUNS IN PARALLEL, AND WHY IT PRINTS AS IT GOES
------------------------------------------------------
Serial, silent and slow is what made this unusable: a full sweep took 100
minutes with no output, which is indistinguishable from a hang, and it was
killed twice before finishing.  Three things fix that, and all three are needed.

*Parallelism.*  Cells are completely independent, so they fan out over
processes.  The catch is that ``DEFAULT_SEARCH_WORKERS = 0`` means each solve
already takes every core, so ``--jobs N`` also pins each cell to ``cores // N``
search workers.  Total CP-SAT threads stay near the core count instead of N
times it -- oversubscribed solvers are slower per cell AND wronger, since a
time-limited solver starved of threads explores less in its allotted seconds.

*Progress.*  Every cell prints when it lands, slowest-first, so a long run is
visibly working rather than apparently wedged.

*A wall-clock cap.* ``--max-seconds`` bounds the whole run and reports cells
whose atomic completion work continues after their requested search deadline.

Ordering matters for the pool: the stress tier goes first, because a 34s cell
picked up last leaves fifteen cores idle waiting for it.
