"""Extract every building's ``PrefabDesc.slotPoses`` from a game install.

    uv run scripts/extract_dsp_slot_poses.py [GAME_DIR]

Writes ``src/flab2bp/dsp/data/slot_poses.json``: for each prefab, the local
model-space pose of every sorter slot the game defines on it.

WHY THIS EXISTS
---------------
``CheckInserterDataLegal`` -- the game's own predicate for "is this sorter's
data legal", ported into ``layout.validate`` as ``game.inserter_data`` -- reads
``PrefabDesc.slotPoses[slot]``, transforms it by the machine's pose, and rejects
the sorter when its end lands further than 0.8 from the result.  Without the
real poses that check cannot run, and we were left inferring the slot ring from
seven observed buildings.

``buildings.json`` already carries a ``slots`` array, and it is NOT this.  In
``PrefabDesc.ReadPrefab`` the game reads ONE component::

    SlotConfig sc = prefab.GetComponentInChildren<SlotConfig>(true);
    portPoses = sc.slotPoses   // fluid / belt ports
    slotPoses = sc.insertPoses // where a sorter may attach

Whatever produced ``buildings.json`` took ``SlotConfig.slotPoses`` -- the fluid
ports -- and called them "slots".  That is why an Assembling Machine came out
with none while the Storage Tank came out with four, and why nothing in this
repo could say where a sorter is allowed to touch a Chemical Plant.  The name
collision is the whole bug: the field a sorter's slot index means is
``insertPoses``.

The poses are Unity ``Transform.position`` / ``.rotation`` -- WORLD space inside
the prefab, which is model-local space for the placed building.  Model space is
Unity's: ``+x`` right, ``+y`` up (away from the planet), ``+z`` forward.  The
mapping onto our tile grid is asserted against the 1288-sorter corpus by
``tests/layout/test_game_slot_poses.py``; nothing here assumes it.

Values are rounded to 4 decimals.  The poses are authored on a 0.4-tile lattice
and the float32 they are stored in carries about 7 digits, so 4 keeps every
distinction the game makes and stops meaningless last-bit churn from showing up
as a diff on re-extraction.
