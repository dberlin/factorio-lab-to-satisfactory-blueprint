"""The bake-off corpus.

Twelve DSP URLs chosen by measuring the real recipe graph rather than guessing,
spanning 1 to ~955 machines and 1 to 42 distinct recipes.  Five entries have
trees touching the LP-ambiguous multi-producer items (the oil and hydrogen
chains), because those are the only place the MILP does work a plain recipe-tree
walk could not.

Machine counts are at the stated rate with the default machine rank, ceiling
rounded, mining excluded.  They are documentation, not assertions -- the dataset
upstream can move.
