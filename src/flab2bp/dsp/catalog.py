"""Ground-truth DSP building geometry and constants.

Everything here was extracted from the game's own assets and then validated
against the 11 real blueprints in ``tests/fixtures``.  Where the two disagreed,
the fixtures won.

Footprints
----------
A building's grid footprint is **derived**, not tabulated: it is the set of tiles
whose *centres* the build collider covers.  Tile centres are
``colliders.GRID_ARC`` = 1.2566 world units apart, so for a building centred on a
tile with collider half-extent ``e`` the occupied tiles are those ``k`` with
``|k| * GRID_ARC < e``, giving

    width = 2 * ceil(e / GRID_ARC) - 1

which is **always odd**.  ``e`` comes from ``PrefabDesc.buildColliders`` -- the
boxes the game's own paste test puts into the physics world -- and NOT from
``blueprintBoxSize``, which the game derives from the one Build box those
exclude.  See :func:`derive_footprint`, which carries the evidence for both
halves of that.

That oddness is not an artifact of the formula -- it is forced by the data.
Across the whole fixture corpus every production building is integer-centred
(Assembling Machine Mk.III 196/196, Matrix Lab 131/131, Negentropy Smelter
100/100, Splitter 25/25, and belts 5729/5866), with not one on a half-integer.
An even-width building centred on an integer would straddle tile boundaries, so
an even footprint is geometrically impossible for anything the corpus contains.

This corrects a earlier table that rounded the collider extent to nearest
(Assembling Machine 4x4, Matrix Lab 6x6, Chemical Plant 8x5).  Rounding is wrong
in both directions -- the assembler is really 3x3 -- so it was not a uniform
off-by-one.  The Chemical Plant is 7x5: it read 9x5 for as long as the divisor
above was 1.0 instead of ``GRID_ARC``, which is the error :func:`derive_footprint`
now records.

.. warning::
   **Never pool fixtures across game versions for geometric validation, and
   never use polar or whole-planet blueprints for it at all.**  Two convincing
   false readings came out of doing so: a Matrix Lab that "measured" 5 tiles
   wide (a 0.8.19 fixture), and a Solar Panel that "measured" 0.075 (a
   whole-planet blueprint, where longitude is latitude-compressed: x-steps of
   4.0 at y=8 but 1.8 at y=17).  Only the two fixtures in
   ``GEOMETRY_SAFE_FIXTURES`` are usable, and both validate at zero overlaps.

    supplied.  ``initialSettingsState`` never sets the field, and the DSP mod
    data carries no ``researchedTechnologies`` default, so a URL without ``tre``
    lands on the unnarrowed set.  The mod defaults corroborate it: FactorioLab
    ships ``maxBelt: conveyor-belt-3`` and a ``maxMachineRank`` of top-tier
    machines, which a save with nothing researched could not build.

    So ``None`` grants every technology, exactly as ``_excluded_recipes`` gives
    ``None`` the mod's own defaults rather than the most restrictive reading.

    .. note::
       **This is a DECISION, not only a reading.**  The user settled it -- "I
       think defaulting to all-researched is a fine default" -- and the
       ``computeSettings`` quote above is why the decision is also the faithful
       one.  Recorded as a decision so that nobody later "corrects" it back to
       the restrictive reading on the grounds that our own evidence is
       second-hand.  If it is ever revisited, revisit it as a product choice.

    This is the THIRD instance today of one class of bug: a URL that is SILENT
    about something read as a URL that FORBIDS it.  The others were recipe
    exclusions (``60d5f0f``, which re-disabled recipes the player had enabled
    and changed the blueprint's inputs) and this one, which refused 19 of 72
    audit cells for want of a slope unlock the player had.  When a field is
    optional, the question is never "what is the empty value" -- it is "what
    does FactorioLab do when it is missing".

    An explicit empty set still means a save with nothing researched, and is
    honoured as such.

    The lab and storage levels are their starting values plus the highest
    researched Vertical Construction level.  ``UnlockValues`` lives in the
    game's binary asset protos and could not be read, so "one per level" remains
    an explicit assumption.  FactorioLab models six levels, giving at most lab
    9 and a ceiling of 26.55, while the user's own save reaches 38.55 at lab 13.
    This under-estimates a developed save, the safe direction: it refuses
    altitudes the save would allow and never emits one it would not.

# --- cargo stacking --------------------------------------------------------
#
# Read out of the game files on this box, never from a live dump: the
# behavioural facts come from an ``ilspycmd`` decompile of ``Assembly-CSharp``
# and the per-level unlock values from ``resources.assets`` via
# ``scripts/extract_dsp_tables.py``.  ``data/stacking.json`` carries the file
# and line for every number; nothing here restates a rule the game owns.
#
# Two things about DSP stacking are easy to get backwards, so they are written
# down here rather than left to the reader of the tables:
#
#   * ``pick_stack`` counts CARGOS, not items.  A sorter picks until
#     ``stackCount == stackInput`` and each pick adds the picked cargo's own
#     stack byte to ``itemCount`` (``InserterComponent.cs:358``, ``:313``,
#     ``:392``).  A Pile Sorter at pick 4 fed a stack-4 belt carries 16 items
#     per swing.  ``place_stack`` is the largest stack it may FORM on the
#     output belt (``:443-448``), and is not consulted at all when inserting
#     into a building (``:471-474``).
#
#   * Only the Pile Sorter's ladder is live.  ``Sorter Cargo Stacking``
#     (techs 3301-3305) carries ``IsObsolete = 1``, which is what hides a tech
#     from the tree (``UITechNode.cs:914``), so ``inserterStackCountObsolete``
#     never leaves its new-game 1 on this build and Mk.III stacks nothing.

#: that the three z values DIFFERED: all 21 three-deep positions are
#: ``(0.0, 0.0, 0.0)``, belts at the SAME altitude in polar and whole-planet
#: fixtures where longitude is latitude-compressed and distinct tiles collapse
#: onto one integer cell.  ``factory-endgame-distribution-hub`` has columns
#: holding 21 belts, all at 0.0 -- a squashed coordinate system, not a
#: 21-storey belt.
#:
#: Re-measuring on undistorted fixtures gave a maximum of 2 distinct altitudes
#: per column, which looked like a rule and is not one either: the vertical form
#: stacks 39 belts at one ``(x, y)`` in the max-height blueprint.  A column
#: bound would have rejected that, so no constant replaces it.


# --- fixtures safe for geometric validation --------------------------------

#: The only fixtures whose geometry can be trusted.  Selected by measurement,
#: not by game version: in each, every machine is integer-centred and every yaw
#: is cardinal, so no latitude compression is present.  Both validate at zero
#: overlaps under the derived footprints.
#:
#: ``factory-heretical-smelter-block`` looks eligible (all 108 machines are
#: integer-centred) but is NOT: 11 of its buildings carry non-cardinal yaw and
#: 376 of its 591 buildings are off the half-grid, so it is latitude-distorted
#: despite being 0.10.34.  Version is the wrong criterion; alignment is the
#: right one.
#:
#: .. note::
#:    ``tests/dsp/test_local_offset.py`` derives a *different* and stricter set
#:    for the same purpose, and the two disagree in both directions.  Its
#:    criterion adds "no two buildings round to the same ``(x, y, z)``", which
#:    catches a distortion that pure alignment misses -- a polar blueprint can
#:    keep whole-number coordinates while collapsing distinct surface tiles onto
#:    one of them.  Under it:
#:
#:    * ``factory-quick-start-step-3-red-cube`` does **not** qualify: 21 of its
#:      232 buildings are off-grid and 9 land on an occupied cell.  A run of
#:      belts near its Storage Tank sits at y = 3.113, 3.987, 4.927, 5.801 --
#:      spacings of 0.87 to 0.94, not 1.0.
#:    * ``12-s-purple-science-from-smelted-refined-products`` **does**, and is
#:      by far the best geometry fixture in the corpus: 3,008 buildings, every
#:      one integer-aligned, no collapsed cells, and a mix of 3x3 assemblers,
#:      5x5 Matrix Labs, 670 sorters and 2,640 belts.

      not the 2.0 ``blueprintBoxSize`` claims.

    clearance is how much room it needs before the next one.  An Assembling
    Machine covers 3 but its collider is 3.82 world units, and a tile is
    ``colliders.GRID_ARC`` = 1.2566 of them -- so 3 tiles is 3.77 and two of
    them at that pitch INTERSECT.  ``geom.collide`` reported 443 such pairs.

    Reserving ``ceil(extent / GRID_ARC)`` per building and keeping the
    reservations disjoint gives a centre-to-centre distance of at least
    ``(cl_a + cl_b) / 2``, which is at least the ``(ext_a + ext_b) / (2 *

    a kind.  It over-reserves by less than a tile per pair, which wastes space
    and can never collide; the reverse trade is what shipped red.

    The extent is measured on the ROTATED collider, not by swapping the two
    numbers: the tested box turns with the building, and a box that is not
    square about its own centre does not have swappable extents.
