"""The planet's longitude bands, and what a paste into one is allowed to be.

A DSP planet is not a plane.  Its build grid keeps a constant number of tiles
per unit of LATITUDE and drops the number of tiles per full circle of LONGITUDE
in steps as you go poleward, so that a tile never becomes a sliver.  The steps
are the "tropics" (``回归线``), and a blueprint that straddles one is refused
outright -- ``EBuildCondition.BlueprintAreaCrossTropic = 45``.

Why this module exists
----------------------
:mod:`flab2bp.dsp.colliders` evaluates its default model on a flat grid at
``GRID_ARC`` in both axes and says so plainly: within the equatorial band that
is the SUPREMUM of the real column spacing, because ``cos(lat) <= 1``.  That
makes every collision it finds real, and it makes every collision it MISSES
possible.  A blueprint that passes there can still be refused when pasted
anywhere but the equator, and a blueprint whose extent does not fit the
equatorial band cannot be pasted at the equator at all.

So "does this layout paste" is not a question about the layout alone.  It is a
question about the layout AND the band, and the band is decided by the layout's
extent.  This module is the band half: the game's own quantisation, the table of
bands it produces, the smallest band a given extent fits, the exact projection
of a blueprint's tile coordinates into that band, and the game's own paste
predicates evaluated on the projected result.

Exactness policy, stated because it differs between the two halves
------------------------------------------------------------------
* **The band index is reproduced in float32, bit for bit.**  It is a DISCRETE
  function of a ``float`` cosine put through a 512-entry lookup, so a one-ulp
  disagreement is not a small error, it is a different band.  Every arithmetic
  step in :func:`determine_longitude_segment_count` is narrowed to float32 with
  :func:`_f32`, and ``MathF.PI`` is the float32 pi the game uses, not
  :data:`math.pi`.
* **The world projection is computed in double.**  The game computes it in
  float32; the disagreement is continuous, relative, and bounded near 1e-6 world
  units over a blueprint-sized patch -- an order of magnitude below the 2e-5
  that ``layout.slots.seated_sorter`` is validated to against sorters the game
  really built.  This is a statement about precision, NOT a tolerance: no
  comparison in this module is softened by an epsilon, and every threshold is
  the game's literal.
* **Nothing here is a rate or a capacity in the metering sense**, so no
  :class:`~fractions.Fraction` appears.  The two quantities that ARE capacities
  -- how many grid rows and how many grid columns a band holds -- are integers,
  and are counted as integers rather than derived from a float.

    Two facts do all the work.  The LONGITUDE step is evaluated ONCE, at the
    anchor's latitude, so it is one constant for the whole paste; each building's
    own latitude then scales its world arc by ``cos``.  The LATITUDE step is
    constant everywhere.  So a paste is a flat grid in the row direction and a
    ``cos``-compressed one in the column direction, and the compression is what
    the flat model in :mod:`flab2bp.dsp.colliders` deliberately ignores.

    #: Modelling the signs SEPARATELY, without moving the anchor, is wrong and

    """``EBuildCondition.Collide`` pairs among machines projected into a band.

    :func:`flab2bp.dsp.colliders.collisions` answers this on a FLAT grid, which
    its docstring identifies as the supremum of real spacing inside the
    equatorial band.  Away from the equator columns are narrower, so the flat
    answer is a lower bound on what a real paste hits.  This asks the same
    question with the real spacing.

    ``colliders.collisions`` already accepts an ``anchor_lat``, and this does not
    use it: that path routes through ``colliders._longitude_segment_count``,
    whose ``segmentTable`` is truncated to its first eight entries and whose band
    index omits the decrement in ``GetLongitudeSegmentCount``.  It is right at
    the equator and wrong in every other band -- 176 instead of 160 at the top of
    band 160, for one.  Replacing it with :func:`longitude_segment_count` is the
    handoff recorded in ``docs/BACKLOG.md``; until then this module does not
    consult it.

    The query box and the target box are both built with
    :func:`~flab2bp.dsp.colliders.target_boxes`.  The two sides differ only in
    whether the collider's OWN quaternion is composed onto the preview rotation,
    and every collider in the shipped data has an identity quaternion --
    ``colliders``' own docstring says so, and
    ``test_every_shipped_collider_quaternion_is_identity`` keeps it true, so this
    shortcut has a guard rather than an assumption.

    ``pairs`` restricts the exact test to a candidate set from
    :func:`candidate_pairs`.  It changes the running time, not the answer:
    anything it leaves out is a pair no projection in the band can bring within
    the sum of its two collider radii.  Passing ``None`` tests everything, at the
    cost of projecting every building whether or not it has a neighbour.
