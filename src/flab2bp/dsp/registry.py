"""What in ``dsp/`` is a game rule, declared rather than guessed.

This module holds no rules.  It holds the *declaration* of which module-level
names in :mod:`flab2bp.dsp` are rules, which are data, and which are quality
knobs -- and, for a rule that is a function of something, what that something
is.  :mod:`flab2bp.dsp.provenance` is the machinery that reads it; the tests in
``tests/rules/`` are what turn it into a number.

Why a declaration and not a heuristic
-------------------------------------

Steps R1 and R2 of ``docs/RULE_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md`` both need to tell a game
constant from a quality knob.  ``freeform.LEVELS = 3`` and
``spine.UNIFORM_ROW_PITCH`` were set by measurement and look exactly like rules;
``1.8975``, ``0.8`` and ``1.6`` are the game's.  No regex over numbers separates
those, and a lint that guesses wrong gets switched off by the next person who
trips on it.  So the distinction is written down here, once, and every mechanism
reads it from here.

The four kinds
--------------

``RULE``
    Falsifiable by pasting: get it wrong and the game draws the build red, or
    silently drops a connection.  These are the entries R2 counts and R4
    perturbs.  A ``RULE`` entry may resolve to a constant *or to a function* --
    see the next section.

``KNOB``
    Set by measurement, tunable without lying about the game.  Density, pitch,
    the altitude we choose to emit.  A knob that migrates into a ``RULE`` row is
    a consolidation that has made the codebase worse.

``DATA``
    Identity and encoding: item ids, recipe names, format versions, fixture
    lists.  Wrong values here break us, but not because the game's *rules* say
    so.

``DERIVED``
    A projection of another declared entry, which must be named in
    ``projection_of``.  A derived value is allowed to have no independent
    citation precisely because it has no independent content.

A rule may be a function of technology level
--------------------------------------------

``docs/RULE_CONSOLIDATION_PLAN.md``: *"a rule whose value depends on researched
tech, building tier, or unlock state is still a rule with a citation -- the
citation just resolves to a table or a lookup rather than a literal."*

So every entry records ``depends_on``: the declared inputs the rule varies over,
in words.  Empty means the rule really is a scalar.  Non-empty means the value
varies, and then exactly one of two things must be true, which
:mod:`flab2bp.dsp.provenance` checks mechanically:

* the entry's value is itself a lookup (a mapping, or a callable taking the
  input); or
* ``resolved_by`` names the ``dsp`` callable that resolves the dependency,
  and the entry is that callable's default or one of its cases.

An entry with a non-empty ``depends_on``, a scalar value, and no ``resolved_by``
is a **flattened rule**: right by coincidence at one tech level and silently
wrong at every other.  ``provenance.flattened()`` reports those, and they are
ledger rows.

``hardcodes`` is the other half of the same idea.  ``DEFAULT_MAX_BELT_Z`` is
``belt_max_z()`` evaluated at the starting lab level; a layout module that reads
it is consulting the rule *at a hardcoded tech level*, which R2 reports
separately from not consulting it at all.
