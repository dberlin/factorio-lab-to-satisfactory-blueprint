"""The ordered routing-path authority and its live endpoint/position indexes.

Mapping reads expose immutable paths in stake insertion order. Only ``stake``
and ``unstake`` mutate the live collection; ordered immutable snapshots restore
all path-derived indexes together. World occupancy and route hints remain the
enclosing route transaction's responsibility.

``sole_neighbours`` takes the router's current cell owner per query rather than
holding a stale copy. Empty paths are staked entries, distinct from absent keys.
