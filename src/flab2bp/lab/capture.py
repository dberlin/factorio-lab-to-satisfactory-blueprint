"""Fetch a FactorioLab CSV export by driving a headless browser.

FactorioLab is a client-side Angular app: the URL carries the settings, the
solve runs *in the page* (GLPK compiled to WASM), and the CSV is produced by
``URL.createObjectURL`` on a Blob built in JavaScript.  There is no endpoint to
GET, so obtaining the player's own solved flow means running the page.

Why not Playwright
------------------

Playwright ships its own browser builds and none are available for this
platform (Fedora 44); ``playwright install chrome`` fails and the bundled
Chromium is not packaged for it.  ``nodriver`` drives a browser that is already
installed over the DevTools protocol, which is the part we actually need.

The waiting problem, which is the whole difficulty
--------------------------------------------------

The page is interactive long before it has an answer, so *time* is not a signal.
A ``sleep(n)`` here would be a flake generator in the worst possible place: it
would sometimes capture an empty or stale export, which parses perfectly and
produces a blueprint for the wrong flow.  That is the silent-wrong-answer class
this program exists to avoid, so every wait below is on a real condition with a
bounded timeout, and a timeout raises naming what it was waiting for.

The conditions, in order, and why each is genuinely downstream of the solve:

1. **DevTools answers** ``/json/version`` -- the browser is up and attachable.
2. **The CSV download button exists.**  This is the strong one.  In
   ``steps.html`` the button is inside ``@if (objectivesStore.steps().length)``,
   so Angular renders it only once the solver has produced steps.  Its presence
   *is* the statement that a solve finished; it cannot appear beforehand.
3. **The steps table has at least one row**, for the same reason from the other
   direction.
4. **The row count is unchanged across two consecutive polls.**  Belt and
   braces: ``steps()`` is a computed that flips atomically from empty to the
   full result rather than filling in, so this should never be the binding
   condition -- but if the app ever changes to stream rows, this is what stops
   us reading a half-built table instead of silently truncating a flow.
5. **A Blob was actually produced** by the click, and it is non-empty.

Capturing the bytes
-------------------

Rather than plumb CDP download behaviour and then poll a directory for a file
that may still be being written, this patches ``URL.createObjectURL`` to keep a
reference to the Blob and then reads it with ``Blob.text()``.  Those are the
exact bytes ``file-saver`` would have written -- the same Blob object -- with no
filesystem race to lose to.  If the app ever stops going through
``createObjectURL``, the reference stays null and this raises rather than
returning something plausible.

There is no fallback.  Every failure here raises :class:`CaptureError`, which is
a :class:`~flab2bp.lab.flow.FlowError`, so a capture that times out or comes
back empty refuses the build.  Quietly re-deriving the recipe selection because
the browser was slow would reintroduce the exact defect this feature removes.
