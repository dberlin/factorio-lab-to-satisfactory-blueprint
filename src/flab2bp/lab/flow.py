"""FactorioLab's own solved flow, read from its CSV export.

FactorioLab's list view has a "download as CSV" button (``Exporter.stepsToCsv``
in ``src/exporter/exporter.ts``).  It writes the flow it solved: one row per
step, naming the RECIPE it chose for each item.  Consuming that selection is the
whole point of this module.  We re-derive nothing about *which* recipe makes
what -- that decision is the player's, made in FactorioLab's UI.  Measured on
the corpus, 17 items have more than one permitted producer and **16 of those
choices move the blueprint's input/output boundary**, which is how a flow
containing no stone produced a blueprint asking the player to belt stone in.

What the file actually is
-------------------------

Read off FactorioLab's own exporter source, not inferred from a sample:

* **Line 1 is** ``"<window.location.href>"`` -- the source URL, wrapped in
  double quotes.  It is the provenance record :func:`verify_provenance` checks.
* **Line 2 is a header of column names** drawn from a fixed vocabulary
  (``StepKeys``), but *only the columns some row fills* are emitted.  The header
  therefore varies between downloads, so columns are read by NAME, never by
  position.
* **Rows are comma-joined.**  The fields that can contain commas -- ``Inputs``,
  ``Outputs``, ``Targets``, ``Modules``, ``Beacons`` -- are written pre-quoted by
  the exporter, so the file is ordinary RFC4180 CSV.  Rows are ragged: a row
  stops at its last filled column.
* **Every numeric cell is** ``"=" + Rational.toString()``.  The leading ``=``
  exists so a spreadsheet evaluates the cell.  ``Rational.toString()`` emits a
  plain decimal *only* when the value survives ``toFixed(3)`` unchanged, and an
  exact ``p/q`` otherwise -- so **a pristine download is exact throughout**,
  including ``Machines`` and ``Items``.

Everything parsed here becomes a ``Fraction``.  No value in this module is ever
a float: belts are sized from these rates and the validator checks capacity
exactly, so a float in this path ships a blueprint that quietly misses its rate,
which is the worst failure mode this program has.

Why not the JSON export
-----------------------

FactorioLab's flow view also offers "download as JSON" (``flowToJson``), and it
looks like the better-structured choice.  It is not, and the reasoning is worth
keeping because it is not visible from the outside -- both files describe the
same solve, and the JSON is the one that loses information:

* ``flowToJson`` writes ``JSON.stringify(flowData)`` where ``flowData`` is the
  **Sankey diagram model** (``src/flow/flow-builder.ts``), not the solve.
* ``link.value`` is a **float** via ``Rational.toNumber()``, and is not even a
  rate: it is scaled to 1/10 for fluids, floored at ``MIN_LINK_VALUE = 1e-10``,
  and its *meaning* is whatever the viewer's ``linkSize`` preference says --
  items, belts, machines, or a percentage.
* ``node.text`` and ``link.text`` are display strings: ``toLocaleString``,
  rounded to the viewer's column-precision preference and locale-formatted.
* **Item nodes are deleted.**  ``buildGraph`` prunes any item node with a single
  source or a single target and re-points the links around it -- exactly the
  shape of an external input feeding one recipe -- so its item set is incomplete
  by construction.  The ``hideExcluded`` preference removes more.
* **It contains no URL**, so a stale export whose selection still parses cannot
  be detected at all.

The decimals in the CSV that look lossy are an artefact of opening the file in a
spreadsheet: ``=25/56`` is a formula, and Excel evaluates it to ``0.446428571``.
The tell is that the *quoted* text cells in the same file keep their fractions
(``coal:2161/3571``) while only the ``=``-prefixed cells lose them.  Verified on
the real sample: ``0.083333333 = 1/12``, ``0.208333333 = 5/24``,
``0.446428571 = 25/56``, each truncated to nine places.  Such a file is still
accepted -- it is what a user is most likely to hand over -- but its mangled
values are flagged :attr:`FlowRow.exact` ``False`` and the cross-check says so
rather than reporting spurious disagreements.

How the selection is applied
----------------------------

:func:`pin_request` rewrites the request's recipe-exclusion set to "every recipe
FactorioLab did not choose".  That is the existing, well-understood lever --
``solve._excluded_recipes`` already treats the URL's exclusion set as
authoritative, "the state of FactorioLab's UI, not a delta" -- so pinning
introduces no new concept in the rate solver, and nothing changes at all for a
build that supplies no flow file.  An item whose only chosen producer is
mining-flagged still falls out as an external input: the pin leaves exactly
FactorioLab's extraction recipes enabled, the rate solver prices those as
supply columns (``solve._extraction_producers``) and never builds one, so
their supply arrives on a belt.

There is no fallback.  Absent, malformed, for the wrong URL, or naming a recipe
we cannot build: this module raises.  Silently re-deriving the selection is the
behaviour it exists to remove.

    Machine counts legitimately differ between our proliferation candidates, so
    the caller must say which candidate it is comparing.  When a row has been
    through a spreadsheet its value is no longer exact, and the comparison says
    so rather than reporting a difference the file cannot actually support.

    ``external`` may carry the same derived map used by the frontier boundary
    check, avoiding a second row scan for the chosen candidate.
