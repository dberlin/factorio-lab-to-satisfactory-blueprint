"""What a FactorioLab URL's researched technologies allow a belt to do.

One function, and it exists because the answer was being derived in four
places and reached only one of them.

``pipeline`` derived the rules and passed them to freeform and to the
validator.  ``scripts/audit.py`` derived nothing, so every corpus cell was both
BUILT and JUDGED against whatever the defaults happened to be rather than
against the save the URL describes -- a measurement that could not have caught a
technology-dependent defect in either direction, while reading exactly like one
that could.  ``scripts/ab_compare.py``, ``scripts/solve_probe.py`` and
``flab2bp.bench.runner`` had the same hole.

So the derivation lives here and every caller asks the same question of the same
code.  It sits in ``lab`` rather than in ``dsp`` because it needs the URL parser
and the dataset; ``lab`` already depends on ``dsp`` and ``dsp`` depends on
nothing in ``lab``, so the direction is the one that was already there.
