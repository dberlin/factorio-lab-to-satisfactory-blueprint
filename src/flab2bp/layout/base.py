"""The frozen contract between the layout stage and the encoder.

A ``Placement`` is deliberately dumb: it is a flat list of buildings pinned to
integer grid coordinates, carrying no strategy-specific state.  That is what
lets a single validator judge every layout strategy and a single encoder
serialise them.

Coordinate system
-----------------
Layout works in **integer tile space** in ``x`` and ``y``: ``(x, y)`` is the
*minimum corner* of a building's footprint.  ``z`` is NOT a level index -- it is
the altitude in world units, tiles of height, exactly the number the game reads,
and it is a ``Fraction`` because a belt on a ramp rests at ``1/2``.  A strategy
that routes on an integer lattice converts at emission; see
:attr:`PlacedBuilding.z`.  Translating tile space into the float ``localOffset``
triple that DSP blueprints actually store -- including the centre-vs-corner
convention and the half-tile offsets that differ between odd- and even-sized
footprints -- is the encoder's job and happens in exactly one place.

Connections
-----------
``output_obj`` / ``input_obj`` are indices into ``Placement.buildings``.  The
encoder rewrites them into DSP's ``index`` space.  ``None`` means unconnected
and is encoded as ``-1``.

For a belt, ``output_obj`` names the next tile downstream; belt chains are
forward-linked only, matching what the game emits.  For a sorter, ``input_obj``
is where it picks up and ``output_obj`` is where it puts down.
