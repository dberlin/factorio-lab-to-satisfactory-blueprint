"""One indexed view over a sequence of :class:`PlacedBuilding` records.

The layout pipeline asks the same few questions about a building sequence over
and over -- which machines run this recipe, which sorters feed that machine,
what sits on this tile -- and before this module every one of those questions
was a fresh linear scan, often inside a loop that already scaled with the
building count.

WHY A DICT AND NOT A TABLE LIBRARY

`littletable` and `polars` were both measured against real blueprints before
this module was written (see
``docs/superpowers/evidence/2026-09-07-buildings-index/backend-choice.md``).
Both LOSE to the linear scan they would replace at the sizes this project
produces -- 500 to 6000 buildings -- because each answers a lookup by
materialising a new container: on a 1969-building blueprint, one indexed
lookup costs 3246 us through littletable and 343 us through polars against a
141 us scan, while a plain dict answers in 0.2 us.  So the indexes here are
dicts built in one pass.

The backend is deliberately private to this module.  No caller imports a table
library, receives a backend object, or writes a query expression; every public
method is typed with this project's own types and returns positional building
indices.  Swapping the dicts for something else is a change to this file alone,
and ``tests/test_backend_containment.py`` fails if that boundary is breached.
