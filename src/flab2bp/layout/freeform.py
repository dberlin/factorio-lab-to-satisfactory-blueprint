"""Strategy B -- free-form packing plus belt routing.

Where Strategy A commits to a global skeleton, this places its units anywhere a
2D packer can fit them and then *routes* the belts through whatever space is
left.  The density ceiling is higher because nothing is reserved in advance; the
risk is the classic place-then-route failure, where phase 1 optimises a proxy
that knows nothing about routing and hands phase 2 a placement it cannot wire.

Three things keep that risk bounded:

* **A strip is routable on its own.**  The placeable unit is not a bare machine
  but a *strip*: a run of machines of one recipe, with its input lanes already
  attached above and its output lanes below, each within sorter reach.  Phase 1
  therefore cannot produce a machine that is impossible to feed -- only one that
  is awkward to reach.
* **A reserved margin** on each strip's east and south faces guarantees a
  connected mesh of free cells for the router, rather than a legal-but-choked
  pack.
* **Negotiated congestion** (PathFinder-style rip-up-and-reroute) resolves the
  contention that remains, and a hard iteration cap plus a guaranteed-feasible
  fallback mean ``lay_out`` always returns something valid.

Deliberate simplifications, each with its reason:

* **No splitters.**  A strip gets one output lane *per destination strip*, so
  every net has exactly one source and one sink.  Belts merge natively in DSP
  (two chains pointing at one tile), so many-to-one needs nothing; giving each
  destination its own lane removes the one-to-many case entirely.  The cost is
  extra lanes, bounded by sorter reach at three per side.
* **Level changes cost two tiles.**  Belts climb 0.5 per tile, so one integer
  level is two tiles of run.  The router reserves both.

Where this differs from the written spec, and why
-------------------------------------------------
The spec's §2.3 chose I/O pads with a solver-chosen face.  This implements the
fixed east/south margin instead: it is the same structural guarantee -- every
unit has free cells adjacent to it -- without a face variable per unit, and the
lanes that pads were meant to reach are already part of the strip.

The spec's §5.3 made the tower lattice a fixed blockage set inside phase 1.  That
encoding fights the objective: the lattice extent depends on the final width,
which is the variable being minimised, so fixing it either inflates the bounding
box or under-covers the result.

Towers are therefore placed between packing and routing, by :func:`_power_plan`,
which covers by NEED rather than by grid: every powered tile must have a free
cell within the tower radius, that condition is checked exactly, and a pack that
fails it is refused as infeasible before a belt is laid.  A pack that passes gets
a placement built greedily against the same condition, connected as it grows, and
held in ``keep_out`` so the router paths around it.

This replaced a lattice with a coverage repair behind it, and the repair is the
part that mattered: it ran AFTER routing, so it searched ground the packing and
the router had already spent, and when it found none it returned quietly and the
candidate died on `power.coverage` having paid for a full routing pass first.
The guarantee is now genuinely structural rather than post-hoc -- and covering by
need measured 2-4x fewer towers than the grid it replaced, which is density
rather than tidiness.

    one, and the second shard's five machines had nowhere to put their hydrogen.

    any more, so it never rejects anything and never will while the ban holds.
    That is not a bug to fix by deleting it: it is the check a later ruling

    THIS IS THE SEATING HALF OF THE CORRECTION ``sorter_span`` TOOK IN 5e982bb.
    Both sides were assumed to carry ``SORTER_MAX_REACH`` lanes, counted from the
    machine's FOOTPRINT EDGE, and that is right only for a machine whose insert
    poses sit on that edge with no clearance padding under it.  Two families in
    the catalog break it, in opposite directions:

    * a **Chemical Plant** (and its quantum variant) anchors its north face on
      the row INSIDE its top edge, so the outermost of three lanes above is FOUR
      tiles from anything a sorter can hold: two rows above, three below;
    * an **Assembling Machine** (and the Re-composing Assembler) covers three
      rows and RESERVES four -- its 3.82-unit collider does not fit a 3-tile
      pitch -- and ``_emit_strip`` seats the machines at the top of that band, so
      the padding lands on the south side: three rows above, two below.

    Seating a lane outside that is not a near miss.  ``slots.attachment``
    returns ``None`` for it, ``_link_lane`` places no sorter at all, and the
    machine ships joined to nothing on that lane -- which is what
    ``_machines_without_poses`` refuses on and why the ``organic-crystal`` URL
    refused on every candidate.  Tightening the seat is the fix; widening the
    reach would emit a sorter the game rejects on paste.

    A row is counted only while every row nearer the machine is reachable too,
    so the answer is a contiguous run outward from the band.  It cannot have a
    hole in practice -- span grows monotonically as a lane moves away from the
    one pose row a face offers -- and a prefix is the conservative reading if it
    ever did.

    A BUILDING WITH NO POSES AT ALL GETS THE OLD CONSTANT BACK, deliberately.  A
    Ray Receiver and an Energy Exchanger ship a zero-length ``slotPoses``, so
    every row would score 0 and seating would raise ``cannot be seated`` -- a
    worse message than ``_machines_without_poses``' own, which names the prefab

    ONE ITEM PER LANE, or no seating at all.  Spec §9 R1 bans a mixed input
    lane absolutely -- not chosen and not forced -- because nothing controls the
    interleaving on a belt carrying two items into a machine: whichever item the
    machines are not short of fills the belt and the others back up, and the
    machines starve.  The user reported exactly that build.

    So this searches ONE split, not a ladder.  It used to try one item per lane
    first and then climb -- two to a lane, then three, up to a ``max_per_lane``
    cap -- and a ``prefer_shared`` flag reversed the climb for proliferated
    groups to save Spray Coaters.  All of it is gone, the cap parameter with it:
    a bound on how far mixing may go is machinery for a thing that may not
    happen at all.  A seating that cannot fit one item per lane raises,
    :func:`~flab2bp.layout.strip_variants._logical_strip_plans` turns that into
    a refusal, and the audit says REFUSED, which is the truth.  The alternative
    is worse and not cheaper: an emitted mixed lane is an ERROR under
    ``flow.lane_single_item``, so the cell would come back INVALID having paid a
    full routing pass to discover it.  Here the emitter really does agree with
    the validator rather than race it, because a lane's items are settled at
    seating time and nothing downstream adds one.

    That is NOT true of the coater seat chooser this used to be compared to.
    ``prolif.coater_rides_one_run`` has two clauses and :func:`_coater_seats`
    enforces only the second; the first convicts a belt merge the ROUTER makes,
    long after the seat is chosen, so no pre-routing filter can agree with it
    (spec §9 R9).  Do not cite the coater path as the model for this one.

    A ``lane_fits`` per-lane rate predicate went with them, and deliberately was
    not kept as a seam for single-item lanes: it summed the WHOLE group's
    throughput across every strip against one belt, while a lane serves one
    strip, and :func:`~flab2bp.layout.strip_variants._machine_cap` is already the
    single-item rate gate.  Spec §9 R8 records the measurement.

    ``above_cap`` and ``below_cap`` are THIS MACHINE's rows per side, from
    :func:`_side_lane_caps`, and they are not both ``SORTER_MAX_REACH``: a
    Chemical Plant carries two lanes above and an Assembling Machine two below.

    ``columns`` is how many insert poses one FACE of this machine offers a lane,
    and it bounds the side differently from the row caps: a row cap counts
    LANES, this counts SORTERS.  Every item on a side needs its own column,
    because a machine slot holds exactly one connection -- see
    :data:`~flab2bp.dsp.rules.CONN_SLOTS_PER_OBJECT` and
    ``validate.game.slot_occupancy``.  Mixing two items onto one lane saved a
    row and saved no column at all, which is why "mix harder" used to walk
    straight past the real limit without this bound; with the ladder gone,
    ``columns`` is simply what refuses a side carrying more ingredients than the
    face has insert poses.

    It was missing, and what it cost was not hypothetical.  ``universe-matrix``
    takes six ingredients and produces one, and a Matrix Lab offers three
    columns above and three below: seven sorters into six slots.  The old
    seating accepted it, and the emitted blueprint put THREE sorters on slot 6
    and three more on slot 7 of every Matrix Lab -- measured, 4 shared slots per
    build -- which pastes with four of the six unwired.  A refusal here is the
    honest answer, and it is raised where the arithmetic is visible rather than
    left to surface downstream as an unfed machine.

    ``flank_outputs`` says the product leaves by the machines' EAST face, so the
    output lane costs no COLUMN on the south face, and the ROW it costs need not
    be one a sorter can reach.  That is the one degree of freedom that seats
    seven connections on a building that offers six per pair of faces, and it is
    why ``universe-matrix`` seats at all: a Matrix Lab carries all six
    ingredients on six SINGLE-ITEM lanes, three above and three below, with the
    product out east.

    The drain row is where that sixth lane comes from.  A flanked output's lane
    carries no sorter at all -- ``_flank_lane`` puts the only one on the east
    face and runs a gap belt south into the lane -- so the drain can sit on the
    row PAST ``below_cap``, which is the first row with no ``attachable_columns``
    and therefore useless to an input.  ``below_cap`` still bounds the input
    lanes above (an input lane may never sit past reach); only the output's
    reservation is waived, and only when flanked.  Spec §9 R2 records the
    ruling, and §9 R1 is why it had to be made: the seating this replaced put
    three ingredients on one belt above and three on one below, and a belt
    carrying two items into a machine starves it however the sorters filter.
    That seating is not a fallback any more, it is unreachable -- the row had to
    be freed or the Matrix Lab would refuse, because ``flow.lane_single_item``
    convicts the mixed alternative and this function no longer offers it.

    ``seating_fits`` judges a whole candidate split rather than one lane: it is
    where the caller asks whether the ROWS this split implies can be served at
    all.  A row's distance sizes the sorter that reaches it, and no tier is
    faster than the Pile Sorter, so a lane whose rate exceeds what that tier
    sustains across the row it landed on cannot be built however the picker
    upgrades.  It is a PREFERENCE, not a filter: when no split satisfies it the
    search runs again without it, so a spec that has no servable seating keeps
    exactly the seating it had and is judged downstream as before.

    Returns ``(above, below)``.  ``below`` shares the south side with the output
    lanes, so it is kept as small as possible.

    # CUT 3 -- ROUTING CAPACITY was built here, measured, and taken out.
    #
    # The argument is sound as far as it goes and the brief for this work said
    # it had never been built and measured, so it now has been.  A net whose
    # endpoints straddle a vertical cut occupies AT LEAST one cell on that
    # column, so free cells in a column bound the nets crossing it, and nothing
    # in this model said so while the objective drove straight at the bound:
    # `universe-matrix/no-proliferator` at h=69 packs a column with 70 free
    # cells against 70 nets crossing it.  Slack ZERO, with a band of neighbours
    # at 2.  By counting alone no router can wire that, and `_pack` called it
    # feasible.
    #
    # It was expressed as one `add_cumulative` over the strips' CONTENT spans,
    # charging `LEVELS` cells per machine row and one per lane row, against a
    # column budget that reserved one free cell per net in the block.  It works:
    # h=69 becomes infeasible and is no longer offered.
    #
    # AND IT MADE THE SPEC WORSE, which is what the calibration behind it could
    # not see.  The numbers that motivated it compared DIFFERENT specs -- 4.6
    # free cells per crossing net on `casimir-crystal`, 5.0 on `quantum-chip`,
    # 1.0 on the `universe-matrix` pack -- and that comparison is confounded by
    # spec size.  Within ONE spec it inverts: h=69, the saturated pack, routes
    # all but ONE of its 140 nets given no clock, while h=92, h=116, h=145 and
    # h=185 all satisfy the bound comfortably and leave 12, 26, 14 and 17
    # unrouted.  Rejecting h=69 deletes the best candidate the sweep has.
    # Corpus at 4s: 66/65/66 clean with it against 66/66/66 without.
    #
    # So cut capacity is a NECESSARY condition that is not the binding one, and
    # enforcing a necessary condition that correlates the wrong way inside a
    # spec costs more than it buys. What decides routability here is which cells
    # are free, not how many.
    #
    # AND NO CHEAP ESTIMATE OF "WHICH CELLS ARE FREE" PREDICTS IT EITHER. That
    # was the open question the note above left, so it has now been measured
    # rather than argued, because a cheap predictor is the hinge on which a whole
    # class of redesign turns: replace CP-SAT with a sequence-pair search under
    # annealing, score each arrangement with a fast global router instead of the
    # real one, and search thousands of arrangements instead of five. All of that
    # rests on the surrogate agreeing with `_route_all`.
    #
    # Four estimates were computed on the REAL canvas at the moment before
    # routing -- 270 packs, really routed, on `casimir-crystal`,
    # `information-matrix`, `quantum-chip` and `universe-matrix`, 55 of which
    # failed -- and scored by AUC against what the router then did. AUC 0.5 is a
    # coin flip. Pooled WITHIN (spec, candidate), which is the comparison that
    # matters and the one the calibration above got wrong:
    #
    #   connectivity, nets whose ports are in different components   0.500
    #   the same test on real 3D cells rather than a projection      0.500
    #   coarse capacity-based global router, total overflow          0.535
    #   the same router's worst single-edge overflow                 0.525
    #   free-column fraction                                         0.491
    #   cut-capacity slack -- THE CONTROL                            0.422
    #
    # The control is what makes the nulls trustworthy: cut slack comes out
    # ANTI-correlated, independently reproducing the finding above, so the
    # instrument could have detected a signal and there was none to detect. Hold
    # the height fixed as well, so only arrangement varies, and every one of them
    # sits between 0.495 and 0.513.
    #
    # The global router is genuinely fast -- 69ms against 13.5s of real routing
    # on `universe-matrix`, some 200x -- and a 200x-faster oracle at AUC 0.51 is
    # worth nothing. Emission alone is 0.108s there, which is the floor on ANY
    # routability evaluation since you cannot know which cells are free without
    # it, so such a search gets ~130 evaluations per 15s ceiling and not the
    # thousands annealing wants. What survives the experiment is the opposite
    # conclusion: arrangement decides routability and only the real router can
    # tell you, which is what `_ARRANGEMENTS` spends its solves on.

    # the search burns itself on permutations that differ by nothing.

    # a width increase could be bought back, which is exactly the blend this
    # ordering exists to prevent.
    #
    # A BACKWARD-NET PENALTY WAS BUILT HERE, MEASURED, AND TAKEN OUT -- and its
    # numbers are worth keeping, because half of it was right.
    #
    # The argument: `dx` is an ABSOLUTE value, so a net running the wrong way
    # costs exactly what the same net running the right way costs. But a net
    # leaves its producer's output lane at the EAST end and arrives at its
    # consumer's input lane at the WEST head, so a consumer placed west of its
    # producer makes the belt wrap all the way around the producer. HPWL cannot
    # see that. The term is `max(0, x_i + w_i - x_j)`, the overlap a net has to
    # double back over -- one variable and one inequality per net, since a
    # positive coefficient in a minimisation drives it to its floor unaided.
    #
    # It was tried in two positions, with `tie_break_cap` grown to cover it so
    # width stayed lexicographically above it either way: inside this tie-break
    # tier beside HPWL, and in a tier of its own between width and HPWL. Both
    # move the quantity they aim at -- backward overlap on `super-magnetic-ring`
    # h=29 fell 614 -> 205 -> 144 across off, tier and own-tier.
    #
    # AND BOTH COST CLEAN CELLS, dose-responsively, which is what says it is the
    # term and not the encoding. Corpus at `--budget 4`, against 70.88 clean of
    # 72 over eight runs: 69.00 in the tie-break tier (t = -3.49), 68.62 in its
    # own tier (t = -3.89), and 68.00 when weighted eight times harder inside the
    # tie-break tier (t = -8.21). The harder it is enforced the more it costs.
    # An arrangement multi-start does not rescue it either -- paired against the
    # same multi-start without it, still -1.25 cells.
    #
    # THE OTHER HALF IS REAL AND IS LEFT ON THE TABLE DELIBERATELY. On the 61
    # cells clean in every run of every arm it is -2.40% AREA -- denser on 32
    # cells, larger on 9, biggest wins `information-matrix/free-proliferation` at
    # -572 and -450 tiles -- and the mechanism is plain enough: a belt that does
    # not wrap around its producer does not push the bounding box out. So this is
    # a DENSITY lever that is anti-correlated with routability at a fixed clock,
    # not the routability fix it was proposed as. It belongs in a build that has
    # cells to spare, and it does not belong in the objective while the binding
    # constraint is still whether a pack wires at all.

    """Lanes seated where no sorter of any tier can join them to their machine.

    Three shapes, and they are worth telling apart in the message because they
    call for different fixes.

    THE MACHINE HAS NO INSERT POSE AT ALL.  ``slots.attachment`` reads the
    game's own ``PrefabDesc.slotPoses``, and for a Ray Receiver and an Energy
    Exchanger that array has LENGTH ZERO.  ``BuildTool_Inserter`` will not
    target a building with no pose, so no sorter can attach to one on any face
    at any distance.  ``Strip.input_lane_tiles`` correctly returns 0 for such a
    machine, ``_emit_strip`` then built that row as an empty lane, and ``feed``
    indexed its head -- ``IndexError: list index out of range``.  The OUTPUT
    side did not even crash: ``_link_lane`` finds no usable column, places
    nothing and returns 0, so the machine shipped joined to nothing at either
    end.  That is the shape spine measured on the mode-driven spec -- two Energy
    Exchangers and ZERO sorters in the whole placement, which `validate` called
    ok.

    THE LANE IS SIMPLY TOO FAR from the nearest pose.  A machine's poses are not
    on its footprint edge in general, so a lane that looks two rows clear can be
    three or four tiles from anything a sorter can anchor on, and every tier
    reaches exactly ``SORTER_MAX_REACH``.  Over the 36 corpus specs this is 31
    lanes; the old edge-row arithmetic charged 24 of them a span of 3 -- legal,
    so a sorter was emitted that could not reach -- and the other 7 a span of 4,
    which is `ValueError: span 4 outside 1..3` and is the crash every
    `universe-matrix` stress cell reported.

    THE LANES HAVE POSES BUT NO COMPLETE DISTINCT-SLOT ASSIGNMENT.  Variant
    generation matches every logical item across all lane rows before accepting
    a pose.  If that matching fails, no physical variant exists: falling back to
    each row's first attachment would put multiple sorters in one machine slot,
    and the game would evict all but the last connection written there.

    THE MESSAGE NEVER QUOTES A DISTANCE, because it has none to quote.
    ``sorter_span`` reads the slot table through ``slots.attachment``, which has
    already rejected anything outside ``1..SORTER_MAX_REACH``, so the only
    failing value it can return is 0 -- meaning nothing anchorable was found at
    all, not a measured four tiles.  Printing that 0 as a distance is what made
    the ``organic-crystal`` refusal read "0 tile(s) ... past the 3-tile reach".
    ``_side_lane_caps`` now keeps seating inside what the poses reach, so this
    is a guard against a future seating bug rather than a routine outcome.

    A sorterless belt-port host is not a refusal when every lane can claim an
    authoritative dock.  Output docks merge into their lane; input docks branch
    from their shared lane through explicit splitters, because a belt tile has
    only one output link.

    Returns one description per distinct offending building and combined lane
    role, empty when every lane in the plan can be joined to its machine.

        the least-bad one was returned even when every height failed to wire --
        which meant a pack nothing could connect still came back, still got
        measured, and measured *small*: an unrouted net is a belt run that does
        not exist, so the broken pack has the tighter bounding box and wins.
        That is how a build with 119 unrouted nets scored as the densest
        candidate on offer.

        The old escape hatch, :func:`fallback_placement`, is gone from this path.
        It was documented as routable by construction and is not -- it calls
        ``_build(route=False)``, so it never even attempts the wiring it claims.
        On the calibration spec it returned 3162 tiles against the solver's 2208
        while carrying the same unsourced lanes, so it traded area away for
        nothing.  What replaces it is the shelf packing it was built on, handed
        to :func:`_pack` as a warm start.  It normally bounds the search; the
        first candidate may substitute it only after an exact incumbent proves
        that it fits the same evidence-bound width slack.  It is never used when
        the solve fails.

        Every phase takes what is left of exactly the budget the caller asked
        for, and a phase that finds the clock already spent is not started.

        Running out of it RAISES.  A deadline may cost a placement -- and the
        cells it costs are named in the commit message rather than bought back
        by raising the ceiling -- but it can never return a degraded one: the
        clock is only ever read where the answer is "this net did not route",

        ``attempts`` collects immutable :class:`PackAttempt` records with the
        exact assignment, full detailed routing, static-access failures, and
        promised-versus-realized direct identities. Refusal reporting derives
        counts from those records rather than reducing evidence to an integer.

        ``None`` means no height produced one -- which is a refusal, not a
        degraded answer.  Packs with unrouted nets are discarded here rather than
        ranked below routed ones, so an unwireable pack can never be what this
        returns, and neither can one our own validator rejects.

        ``rejected`` collects ordered structured findings from placements thrown
        out by self-checks or projected geometry, so a terminal refusal can name
        the broken promise and retain the authoritative record that proved it.

        ``skipped_heights`` collects candidate heights whose GREEDY SEED extent
        fits no band.  They are kept apart from ``rejected`` deliberately: that
        gate fires before `_pack`, so no pack ever existed, and feeding it into
        ``rejected`` made `lay_out` report "every packing that wired was rejected
        by our own validator" for a cell where nothing wired (R1 §0).  The
        POST-pack gate still retains a real pack's rejection.

        ``telemetry`` receives this sweep's counters whatever the outcome, so a
        refusal can carry them.  `best.stats` is stamped only when a placement
        exists, and a refusing cell is precisely the one whose numbers a gate
        needs.

        ``time_budget_s`` bounds the WHOLE sweep, not just CP-SAT.  It used to
        bound only the packing: routing is limited by an expansion count, not a
        clock, so a 1s budget could spend 13.5s and a 4s budget 68.6s -- both on
        specs that then refused.  A caller who says one second and waits over a
        minute has not been given a budget, and the bake-off cannot sweep a
        parameter the code ignores.

        The deadline is polled between search phases and inside preparation,
        routing, compaction, and final projection. An interrupted candidate is
        discarded because a half-routed or half-certified pack is not a result.
        Certification is checked again after it returns, so a completed phase
        that crossed the wall can never install a late placement.

        # The story was that the scarce resource is the east-west corridor: a
        # strip's machine band blocks the bottom three levels, so the only way
        # past a strip is the one-row channel on its south face, and a wide pack
        # asks its nets to cross the whole width through those. That is not what
        # the failures are. Flooding from the start cells of failing searches
        # says the median reachable region is ONE CELL -- see
        # `_reserve_port_access`, which now holds the way out of it. Nothing is
        # crossing anything; the source port cannot leave its own access cell. A
        # one-row corridor also carries several belts, not one, since only a
        # machine denies the whole band -- and since `LEVELS` rose to 4 a net
        # can go OVER the strip as well as around it.
        #
        # What the measurement under it DOES show is that some heights wire and
        # others do not, unpredictably, and shortest-first can spend the whole
        # ceiling short of the one that would. Routing every candidate height of
        # `quantum-chip/max-proliferation` with a 20M expansion budget and no
        # clock: h=30 w=104 left two nets unrouted, h=40 w=87 three, h=50 w=61
        # four, h=62 w=52 three, and h=80 w=39 routed EVERY net. It reads as a
        # width story and is not one -- `quantum-chip/no-proliferator` at a fixed
        # w=56 fails 12 nets at h=170, none at h=255 and h=340, and one again at
        # h=595, on a canvas with 33,000 tiles for 40 strips. Which heights wire
        # is a property of the arrangement, not of how much room it has.
        #
        # It measured 60/72 clean at 4s, which is what shortest-first measures,
        # with the refusals shuffled between cells. The gain on `quantum-chip` is
        # paid straight back on `universe-matrix`, whose tall packs are both
        # wider AND slower to route, so the sweep reaches fewer of them. Reverted
        # for want of a number, not for want of a reason: a height ORDER that
        # depended on the strips rather than on a fixed direction is the shape
        # this wants, and nobody has built one.
        #
        # `universe-matrix` is where that would have to pay off and it is not
        # close. With the port exits held, its five candidate heights at 10s of
        # packing each and NO routing clock leave 29, 4, 26, 23 and 10 nets
        # unrouted -- so no order over these five reaches a pack that wires, and
        # each pass costs 25-40 seconds against a ceiling of 15 or 120. All six
        # of its cells refuse at both budgets and they are named in the commit
        # message rather than bought back.
        # SO HERE IS THAT ORDER, AND IT DEPENDS ON THE STRIPS.
        #
        # A fixed band first prefers the greedy envelope with the most exact
        # latitude-padding choices. A zero-headroom envelope can route and only
        # then fail projection; spending a short budget on it prevents a later
        # proved-fit height from running. Within equal projection headroom, and
        # for portable layouts, try the warm-start with the smallest LONGEST
        # AXIS first. The detailed router, boundary projection, and exact

                # 60 a tier-`large` candidate costs a second or two against a share
                # of sixty, so they all run and the density win stands.

    Pure, and deliberately the SAME predicate `_sweep`'s acceptance path spells
    inline.  The two are not shared on purpose: this one is an optimisation --
    it decides whether a candidate is worth certifying at all -- and the
    acceptance one is the authority that decides what is returned.  Keeping the
    authority independent means a wrong answer here can only cost clock, and it
    is what lets a test force this gate open and compare the two runs.

    ``incumbent_key`` is ``None`` until a candidate has been CERTIFIED clean, so
    the first completed candidate always answers True: the sweep never skips its
    way into having no measured certify span, and a candidate the validator
    rejects leaves the key it was measured against untouched.

    WHAT THE GATE PROMISES, AND WHAT IT DOES NOT.  It does not promise the same
    placement on every input, and the reason is the clock rather than the
    ranking.  A skipped certify is time the candidate's turn does not spend, so
    the `candidate_total_s` it is charged comes out smaller and with it both
    terms taken from it -- `dearest_candidate_s` and the `candidate_totals_s`
    `_next_candidate_seconds` takes its median over.  `validation_reserve_s`
    likewise becomes a maximum over incumbent-sized certifies alone.  All three
    feed `_room_for_another` and the completion-reserve break, so this sweep can
    START a candidate the un-gated one would have refused admission.

    What does hold, and what the tests pin:

    * the certified set is a SUBSET of the set certifying everything produces;
    * among the candidates actually evaluated, selection is bit-identical -- the
      key is read before certification and no report can move either term, so a
      skipped candidate is one the acceptance comparison would have rejected;
    * every budget term the skip perturbs can only SHRINK, so the sweep explores
      a SUPERSET of the un-gated candidates and the placement it returns is no
      worse than the un-gated one on `(area, belt_tiles)`.

    The extra candidate is bought inside the gate's own wall, so Ruling D2 leaves
    this as it stands and checks it at the gate's ``wall_overshoot_s`` maximum
    rather than with a code change here.

    The median of what the completed candidates actually took, and zero until

    THE MAXIMUM WAS THE WRONG STATISTIC.  A sweep's candidate costs are not
    symmetric: most candidates route in a comparable time and one occasionally
    walks into a congestion wall and burns several times that.  Charging the
    next candidate the dearest one ever seen therefore prices it at the outlier,
    and the sweep hands the clock back rather than spend it -- 6-37 % of every
    30 s budget on the profiled cells (speedups-2 design L5).

    Under-estimating is cheap and over-estimating is not.  A candidate admitted
    on a median it then over-runs is abandoned at the pack budget's
    ``remaining <= 0``, at the completion-tail check that follows its pack, or by
    `_expired(completion_deadline)` inside the completion transforms; in every
    one of those the sweep still holds an incumbent that is already compacted,
    finalized and certified, so what the abandoned candidate cost is clock and
    nothing else.  A candidate REFUSED on an outlier's price, by contrast, is a
    draw at a denser placement that was affordable and never taken.

    What must NOT be estimated this way is the completion tail; see

    candidate's own compaction, finalization and certification.  Adding the
    reserves on top therefore counts the tail twice, and on a cell whose
    candidates all cost about the same the sum comes out ABOVE the dearest
    candidate the sweep ever completed: `[8, 8, 8]` with a 3 s tail asks for
    11 s where the old rule asked for 8.  A lever meant to spend more budget
    must not be able to refuse a candidate the rule it replaces would admit.

    ``dearest_candidate_s`` -- the old charge -- was itself wall-safe precisely

    Both clocks have to allow it and they say different things.  ``soft`` is the

    wall and is what stops it entirely.  A candidate started against either one
    with no room to finish is a candidate whose whole cost is wasted -- the sweep
    already holds a routed placement, so an abandoned improvement buys nothing
    and spends the clock a later spec-critical pass might have used.

    THE CHARGE IS TWO DIFFERENT KINDS OF NUMBER and they used to be one.

    ``completion_tail_s`` is what MUST fit, and it is always a maximum: the
    compaction, finalization and validation reserves, each the dearest span this
    sweep has measured for that transform.  Those three are the exact work that
    turns a routed candidate into a placement this program will emit, they are
    not interruptible into anything useful, and a sweep that starts a candidate
    without room for them has bought a routing pass it cannot cash.

    ``next_candidate_s`` is what the next turn's own work is EXPECTED to cost,
    and it deliberately need not be a maximum -- see `_next_candidate_seconds`
    for why the median is the honest estimate and what an under-estimate costs.

    The two are added, so the caller decides the split.  A caller charging a
    span it has MEASURED WHOLE -- a queued repair's post-pack remainder, a
    window's bounded solve plus that remainder, a projection retry's whole
    candidate -- passes it as ``next_candidate_s`` with a zero tail, because
    such a span already contains its own completion transforms and adding the
    reserves on top would charge for them twice.  Only the fresh-candidate gate
    in :meth:`FreeformLayout._sweep` splits them.
