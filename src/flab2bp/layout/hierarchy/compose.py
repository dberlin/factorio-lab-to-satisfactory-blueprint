"""Lay every solved block on one canvas and route the cuts with the real router.

The prototype
(``docs/superpowers/evidence/2026-09-06-exp-hierarchical/proto/compose.py``)
wired the cuts with its own corridor Dijkstra, on the reading that
``freeform._route_all`` "is not callable standalone".  That reading is wrong:
``_route_all`` takes a prepared :class:`~flab2bp.layout.routing_domain._Canvas` and a
list of :class:`~flab2bp.layout.routing_domain._Net`, and ``tests/layout/
test_freeform.py`` already calls it that way. Internal cuts use the router's
port-access reservations and physical crossing bands, not prototype collider
halos, soft moats or altitude tolls. Composition also holds complete player-entry
approaches: a cut's immediate access cells cannot preserve outside connectivity.

The packing does survive, verbatim: ``_normalize``, :func:`pack_blocks` (the
prototype's ``_shelf`` without its single-row mode), :func:`_skyline` and
``_translate``. The two-tile gap floor remains because ``game.belt_collide``
prices a belt against a neighbour's build collider. Candidate admission uses
the finalizer's exact requested band envelope, not a second latitude ceiling.

#: The narrowest gap a packing may leave between two blocks.

#: The gaps a packing may be tried at, narrowest first.
#:
#: A block solved on its own owns every tile of its own box, so the ONLY ground
#: an inter-block cut can run on is the gap the packing left between the boxes.
#: At :data:`MIN_GAP` that ground is two tiles wide and already carries the
#: neighbours' belt colliders, which is why the v1 gate measured the router
#: refusing 8-50 lanes on belt3 dominated by ``DYNAMIC_ACCESS`` -- and why
#: DOUBLING the routing budget to 120 s did not change the class.  A router that
#: refuses the same way with twice the wall is not short of time; it is being
#: handed a canvas with nowhere to run, and the fix is more ground rather than
#: more clock.
#:
#: The rungs double and then step, because the cost of a rung is a whole
#: re-pack plus a whole reservation: a fine ladder would spend the composition's
#: budget proving that 3 is as hopeless as 2. The measured ladder stops at 16;
#: widening it is a separate search-policy decision, not band admission.

#: been committed before there was a ladder -- so it runs on the caller's own

#: funded out of something.  Handed the whole clock the ladder can pay for six
#: packs, six canvases and six reservations, hand ``_route_all`` a deadline that
#: has already passed, and refuse under ``BUDGET`` on cuts the first rung would
#: have wired -- a wider canvas nobody has the wall left to route on is not an
#: improvement, it is a regression wearing one's clothes.
#:
#: The majority stays with the router because the router is the stage that
#: actually produces belts; the ladder only decides which ground it produces
#: them on.

#: an A* per option per demand, so an unbounded rung 0 could spend the wall
#: `_route_all` needs and refuse on BUDGET the cuts a cheaper oracle would
#: have wired -- the same trade `LADDER_WALL_SHARE` exists for one rung up.
#: On its own expiry rung 0 is RE-JUDGED with the local-only oracle
#: (`goals=None`) on the caller's full clock, so the degradation is to v2's

    `_reserve_port_access`.  It is pure, so the two agreed -- but agreeing
    twice costs the wall :data:`RESERVE_WALL_SHARE` exists to protect.

    THIS IS WHAT MAKES THE ORACLE ABLE TO SAY NO.  Every demand
    `_port_access_inventory` builds from a composed packing is an
    `INTERNAL_DEPARTURE` or an `INTERNAL_ARRIVAL`, both `reaches_boundary`

    lane head's corridor reach the far end of the trunk it is an end of.

    WHAT IS DELIBERATELY WEAKER THAN ROUTING.  A demand is deduplicated by
    `(cell, kind)`, so one lane head can be the end of several nets; the goal
    is the UNION of its partners' doorsteps, which asks "can it reach AT LEAST
    ONE of them" rather than all of them.  That is a necessary condition, not
    a sufficient one: it can still admit a rung the router then refuses, but
    it can no longer admit a rung on which a lane head is sealed away from
    every partner it has.  Probing per partner would multiply the A* count by
    the fan-out for a claim the router re-checks anyway.

      on the ground as it now stands, with the partial's corridors staked; the
      goal-driven call counted on a canvas cleared of every corridor, which is a
      canvas that no longer exists.  This is also the only field that reaches a
      reader: `_corridor_evidence` prints `options=<local_options>`.
    * ``frontier`` / ``exhaustive`` are the GOAL-DRIVEN call's.  They are the
      trunk probe's findings and the local-only top-up cannot produce them: it
      runs unprobed, so it reports an empty wall and ``exhaustive=False``, which
      would read as "nobody looked" rather than "we looked and it is sealed".

    ``held``/``wanted`` are the same constants in both.  An entry only the
    goal-driven call raised is kept verbatim: that demand is one the top-up
    SERVED, so there is no fresher count to take and nothing to merge.

    """Give the demands a partial left missing the local-only oracle's corridor.

    THE PARTIAL IS BETTER GROUND WHERE IT SPEAKS AND STRICTLY WORSE WHERE IT IS
    SILENT.  Before the matcher committed partials it gave up wholesale, and
    `pack_with_access` re-asked `_reserve_port_access` WITHOUT `goals` for every
    demand -- the local-only oracle -- which staked a corridor for each one.
    Committing a partial deleted that fallback for exactly the demands the
    partial's own survey convicted, and `_route_all` then met each of them as
    `no port access corridor (held=0 wants=1)`: one unroutable cut per missing
    demand, which is how `titanium-glass/all-products` went from wiring all 26
    of its cut lanes to refusing at the router with 4 unrouted cuts.

    So the partial's corridors are KEPT and the demands it left missing are
    asked again locally.  Three things this must not do:

    * It must not re-assign a demand the partial already served -- `held` says
      so, and the union below prefers the partial's own pair either way.
    * It must not report a VERDICT.  `converged` stays False however complete
      the merged answer looks, so `reservation_degraded == 0` keeps its single
      meaning ("the matcher converged") and the rung still counts as both
      partial and degraded.
    * It must not cost the caller the partial.  A top-up that runs out of the
      rung's clock degrades to the partial as it stood: `_reserve_port_access`
      restores the canvas to its entry snapshot on every raising path, and that
      snapshot IS the partial, so both the object and the canvas fall back
      together.

    The canvas union is `_reserve_port_access`'s own `held` contract; see its
    docstring for why a second call without it would wipe the first's corridors
    off the canvas the router reads.

    THE `assigned` UNION BELOW IS THE AUTHORITATIVE ONE.  `_reserve_port_access`
    computes its own -- it has to, because the canvas union and the `missing`
    it derives both depend on it -- but this one is recomputed from
    `committed.assigned` rather than read off `topped`, so a future change to
    `held`'s ordering or merge semantics in freeform cannot silently change what
    the rung commits.  The two are belt and braces, and THIS is the belt.

    A TOPPED-UP RUNG COMPLETES, AND THEREFORE ENDS THE GAP LADDER, at
    `pack_with_access`'s `if reservation.complete: return candidate`.  That is
    inherent in the property this function exists for -- an empty `missing` --
    and it is the pre-Task-1 shape restored: the wholesale local-only fallback
    also produced a complete reservation and also short-circuited, which is how
    v3's titanium-glass committed at gap 2 and wired all 26 cut lanes.  The
    consequence for a reader of the stats line is that `reservation_degraded`
    and `reservation_partial` are ladder totals over FEWER rungs than before, so
    a fall from 5 to 1 is the ladder stopping sooner and NOT the matcher
    converging more often.

    THE TOP-UP IS THE LOCAL-ONLY ORACLE ONLY WHILE `boundary` IS None.
    `boundary` is forwarded exactly as the wholesale `else` branch forwards it,
    which is the consistency worth having, and `pack_with_access` computes it as
    None today because no composed demand answers `reaches_boundary`.  The day
    the v2 gate's lever 1 gives the composer real boundary ports, `probed`
    becomes True here too: this call would build a grid and run an A* per
    option, and it would stop being the cheap unprobed pass the wall budget
    assumes.  Re-measure the rung cost on that day.

    ``external_spec`` supplies settled machine incidence and declared player
    inputs when those differ from the packing spec. First reserve the actual
    internal port corridors, then find complete external paths to the canvas rim
    without taking those corridors. External protection never degrades to a
    local doorstep check.
    If every attempted packing lacks such a path, raise _ExternalAccessRefused.

    THE GAP IS A SEARCHED QUANTITY, not a constant.  Every rung of
    :data:`GAP_LADDER` at or above ``gap`` is packed, and the reservation is
    asked whether every lane head can still be given a corridor of its own.
    The first rung it answers yes for is committed.  The canvas rim goes with
    the question only when some demand's kind could actually be probed against
    it -- see the comment at the call.

    Stake every port's approach before any path commits, the way
    `_prepare_routing_problem` does.  A boundary lane's end tile has at most
    three free neighbours and often one; without the reservation an earlier
    net's path takes the last one and every later net using that port is handed
    an empty start set -- a search that expands nothing and so registers no
    congestion for the negotiation to price.

    UNDER A BOUNDED SHARE OF THE ROUTE'S CLOCK.  The reservation enumerates
    every candidate corridor of every demand and then solves a JOINT MATCHING
    over them, so its cost grows with the interface rather than being a fixed
    preamble; a ladder multiplies that by its rungs.  The FIRST rung is what a
    ladderless composer would have done and runs on ``deadline`` itself -- all
    but its RESERVATION, which is capped at :data:`RESERVE_WALL_SHARE` because
    the trunk goals turned that reservation into an A* per option per demand,
    and which degrades to the local-only oracle on the caller's full clock
    rather than refusing when that cap bites.  Every rung after the first is
    speculative and is funded out of :data:`LADDER_WALL_SHARE` of the wall left
    on entry, so that ``_route_all`` is never handed a clock the search for a
    wider canvas has already spent.  The ladder stops the moment that share
    runs out:

    * with a rung already judged, the best one in hand is returned -- it is a
      real packing with a real verdict, and spending the router's wall to find
      a wider canvas nobody can then route on helps nobody;
    * with NO rung judged, :class:`_PackingDeadline` carries the packing out to
      the caller, which owes its own caller a refusal naming every cut.

    AND DEGRADING TO v2's ORACLE RATHER THAN ACTING ON AN UNUSABLE ANSWER.  A
    rung whose trunk-goal reservation either outran rung 0's share or came back
    having assigned NOTHING AT ALL is re-asked LOCAL-ONLY on that rung's own
    clock, and it is the local answer the rung is judged by.  Both triggers
    take one path so there is a single behaviour to reason about, and
    :attr:`PackedCanvas.degraded` counts how often it fired -- without which a
    committed rung reporting no missing corridors cannot be told apart from one
    whose oracle was thrown away.

    ``gap`` is a FLOOR, not the gap: a caller that knows two blocks cannot be
    laid closer than 8 passes 8 and the ladder starts there.  When the floor is
    above every rung the floor itself is the only rung, since a ladder must
    always try at least once.
