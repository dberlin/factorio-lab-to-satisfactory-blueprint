"""The lane contract between two solved blocks.

A ``Cut`` (``hierarchy.partition``) names an item and a net rate crossing from
one block to another, but that is not enough to wire a belt: each block sizes
its own lanes independently from its own rates, and they do not agree in count
or in per-lane rate (README ``2026-09-06-exp-hierarchical`` section 1, "The
block interface is a LANE CONTRACT, not an item name" -- on ``zurl2``, ten of
eleven point-to-point cuts fail on lane-count mismatch alone).

This module turns a cut into the thing a router actually needs: an exact
transportation assignment from the producing block's rated output tails to the
consuming block's rated entry heads. Fan-out (one tail feeding several heads)
and fan-in (several tails filling one head) are both legal -- the composer
(``hierarchy.compose``, Task 5) treats a shared source port as one family of
taps and merges a second feed into an existing lane, so a ``LaneFlow`` is
simply one edge of the assignment, not a claim that one tail wires one head.
