"""Rate-weighted partition of a ``BuildSpec``'s recipe DAG into blocks.

The design, and where it departs from the brief:

* Nodes are *units*: one per ``MachineGroup``, pre-split so no unit exceeds the
  machine cap.  A unit is ``(recipe_id, count)`` -- splitting a group is exact,
  because every rate in a ``MachineGroup`` is per-machine.
* Edges are rate-weighted: the item flow from producer unit to consumer unit,
  apportioned by share when several units make or take the same item.
* Blocks come from agglomerative merging on the heaviest edge, capped by
  machines per block.
* Cuts are read off NET per-block balances, not off "who produces this
  anywhere", because a block that both makes and takes an item can still be
  short of it after integer rounding.

See ``docs/superpowers/evidence/2026-09-06-exp-hierarchical/README.md`` ("The
repair that does not work") for why there is no repair loop here: rate-
splitting an item's producing units into each consuming block to remove a
multi-consumer cut does not converge -- every move plants the producer's own
ingredient demand in new blocks, creating fresh multi-consumer cuts one level
upstream. A production version has to build the splitter, not dodge it.
