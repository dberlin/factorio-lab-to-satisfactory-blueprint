"""The hierarchical strategy: partition, solve the blocks, compose, certify.

This module is ORCHESTRATION ONLY.  Every decision with geometry in it lives in
a sibling: :mod:`~flab2bp.layout.hierarchy.partition` decides where to cut,
:mod:`~flab2bp.layout.hierarchy.contracts` decides which output lane feeds which
entry lane, :mod:`~flab2bp.layout.hierarchy.compose` packs the solved blocks and
runs the real router over the cuts, and the two production backends lay out the
blocks themselves.  What is left here is the loop: hand each block to the
placers, re-cut the ones that refuse, wire what came back, and judge the whole
thing once.

WHY THE CHILDREN ARE CONSTRUCTED HERE RATHER THAN VIA ``pipeline._new_layout``.
``pipeline`` imports this module -- ``_new_layout`` has to be able to return a
``HierarchicalLayout`` -- so importing ``pipeline`` back would be a cycle, and
the usual escapes (a function-level import, or a ``TYPE_CHECKING`` alias plus a
runtime lookup) buy nothing: ``_new_layout`` is a two-branch constructor call
and nothing else.  :func:`_block_layout` is that call, written out, at module
scope where mypy and the import graph can both see it.

HOW THE BUDGET IS DIVIDED.  Offered ``(shape, arm)`` jobs are grouped once,
in source order, with every consuming block retained for result fanout.
Funding considers wave-derived budgets and remembered-budget breakpoints,
bounded by ``[BLOCK_BUDGET_MIN_S, BLOCK_BUDGET_MAX_S]``. In descending budget
order, the first candidate affordable for its actual eligible work is selected.
A remembered threshold is itself eligible as a budget: equality skips that job
and may free wall for others. All jobs remembered at the ceiling require no
submissions. See :func:`allowed_recut_rounds` for ``rounds_left``.
:func:`settlement_reserve_s` comes off the top, because composing, ROUTING EVERY
CUT LANE, compacting, finalizing and certifying happen after the last block and
have no budget of their own. A non-seed round is refused only when its actual
active waves cannot fit at the floor -- the seed round is exempt even then: a
build that refuses having attempted nothing reports nothing, so its share is
floored to ``BLOCK_BUDGET_MIN_S`` instead and it runs anyway.  The per-job wall
is combined with the parent's deadline inside :func:`_solve_block`, at job
start -- see its docstring for why the parent cannot do it.

FEASIBILITY BEFORE OPTIONAL DENSITY WORK. A shape gets one offered arm at a
time, with unresolved shapes ahead of fallback arms. A valid primary suppresses
unused alternatives; already completed valid results retain offered-order
area ties. Refused divisible parents use an existing useful cut before another
round widening the parent. Indivisible parents retain untried-arm fallback.
The global funding and recut bounds still apply: the web UI's 15 s budget
normally funds only the seed round, so it cannot promise a child round.

WHAT THE PARENT PROMISES A CHILD.  A block can finish early but never outlives
the build.  It does NOT get the parent's band policy: the composer discards each
block's own frame (``compose._normalize``) and repacks it, so a child's policy
only shapes its SEARCH, while the composed placement is what gets finalized
against ``self.band_policy`` and certified.

WHAT COMPOSITION COSTS, AND WHY FINALIZATION IS NOT OPTIONAL.  Packing puts
blocks on different latitude rows, which re-prices every east-west spacing
inside them; a block certified where it was solved is not certified where it
landed, and ``game.power_too_close`` is the usual way that shows up.  So the
composed placement is compacted, finalized and certified here, from scratch,
and a :class:`finalize.ProjectionRefusal` is a refusal with the projection
named -- never a crash and never a handback.

THE CONSTANTS AS SHIPPED, in one place, because they differ from the ones the
plan proposed and each is spelled out separately below:

* ``settlement_reserve_s(budget) = min(40, max(5, 0.4 * budget))`` -- a share
  of the budget, not the plan's flat 5 s.  The floor dropped from 10 s to 5 s
  (v2 Task 3): at the web UI's 15 s default the old floor alone (10 s) left a
  5.0 s round -- exactly ``BLOCK_BUDGET_MIN_S``, so any wall at all spent
  partitioning tipped it under the floor and the build refused having
  attempted nothing.  The NEW floor only binds below a 12.5 s budget, but the
  CHANGE reaches further than that: the old 10 s floor bound every budget
  under 25 s (``0.4 * budget < 10`` there), so every build in ``[12.5, 25)``
  also gets a smaller reserve now (``0.4 * budget`` instead of the old flat
  10 s) even though the new floor itself is not what is binding for it.
* ``_pool_width() = max(1, min(_POOL_CAP, workers or _available_cpu_count()))``
  with ``_POOL_CAP = 32``. Independent shapes get workers before any one
  child's CP-SAT search does: a round divides the aggregate share by its
  concurrent shape count, capped at ``_BLOCK_WORKERS = 4`` per child.
  Reserving four workers per block made an eight-worker portfolio arm only
  two jobs wide, refusing re-cut rounds with useful shapes still unattempted.
  The pool remains capped for interpreter memory, and a round with few
  eligible shapes can still give each child multiple search workers.
* The per-JOB deadline is ``min(parent_deadline, job_start + block_budget)``,
  computed inside :func:`_solve_block` at job start rather than by the round.
* ``MAX_RESPLIT_ATTEMPTS = 4`` is counted PER BLOCK, not as a global round
  bound: a child created by a re-cut starts at attempt 0.  The GLOBAL bound
  is ``MAX_RECUT_ROUNDS = 2``, floored further by
  :func:`allowed_recut_rounds` to what the round wall can actually hold at
  ``BLOCK_BUDGET_MIN_S`` -- 0 at the web UI's 15 s, which is what gives the
  seed round the whole wall there (v3 Task 2).
* Per round, ``block_budget = clamp(remaining / rounds_left / waves, 5, 20)``
  seconds, where ``rounds_left`` is this round plus the re-cuts still
  permitted.  Dividing by ``waves`` alone let one round spend the wall the
  NEXT round -- against a block count that round had grown -- would need:
  v2 measured both malls refusing with 22 and 45 blocks never placed.
* A ``(shape, arm)`` no-good memo, local to one :meth:`lay_out` call (v2 Task
  5): ``_solve_round`` solves each distinct shape AT MOST ONCE per round --
  two same-shaped children of one re-cut block routinely land in the same
  round and are answered together rather than asked twice -- and skips a
  ``(shape, arm)`` a prior round already saw refused at this budget or
  higher, without building its sub-spec. ``_next_cut`` skips a cut whose
  every child is remembered refused for every arm, trying the next attempt
  instead. ``stats["nogood_skips"]`` counts TWO different savings in one
  number: the ``(block, arm)`` pairs a SAME-ROUND duplicate shape answered
  without a job of its own, plus the ones a CROSS-ROUND memo hit skipped.
  A refusal is remembered at the wall the job actually received rather than
  at the nominal budget -- see :meth:`_solve_round`.
* The pool is SPAWNED (``multiprocessing.get_context("spawn")``), like
  ``strategy_race``'s, and built ONCE per :meth:`HierarchicalLayout.lay_out`
  call rather than once per round (v2 Task 3): every round of one build shares
  it, so the pool's own spawn start-up -- real wall on a process pool, paid by
  the first job submitted to it -- is paid once per build rather than once per
  round, and a re-cut's extra round does not pay it again.

The same list, with the gate measurements behind it, is
``docs/superpowers/evidence/2026-09-07-hierarchical-v2/gate.md`` -- whose §8
explicitly SUPERSEDES v1's, so it is the current one.  v1's
``docs/superpowers/evidence/2026-09-07-hierarchical-v1/gate.md`` is kept as the
historical record the constants above were first measured against.

        diagnostic label -- see `_solve_round`'s docstring), so two
        same-shaped blocks funded at the same budget score the same features,
        and `plan_strips` is the only expensive thing here.

        THE CACHE KEY CARRIES THE BUDGET.  Two rounds of one build hand the
        same shape different per-block budgets (`clamp(remaining / rounds_left
        / waves, 5, 20)`), and the answer legitimately differs across
        `dispatch.SEQUENCE_PAIR_EXACT_FLOOR_S` -- so a shape-only key would
        serve a later, better-funded round with an earlier round's answer.
        `plan_strips` still runs at most once per (shape, budget), which is
        what the cache is for.

        A block that has already tried its dispatched arm gets the FULL set
        if it survives recutting (for example, an indivisible parent).

        THIS RUNS IN THE ORCHESTRATOR, NOT A GUARDED WORKER (v3 Task 3 fix

        freeform packer internals -- and `_solve_block`'s own docstring names
        a precedent: a freeform-internals crash "took the whole run with it"
        when it escaped unguarded.  `_arms_for` is called from `lay_out`'s
        round loop, inside `with executor as pool:` but with no enclosing
        `try`, so a `dispatch.block_features` crash here would break the
        `Placement`-or-`NoValidLayout` contract this method promises, for a
        reason that has nothing to do with the block itself.  Degrading to
        the FULL arm set on failure is the same escape valve shape as the two
        `dispatch.UNCOVERED_*` branches: retain alternate feasibility backends
        rather than lose the whole build to a feature-vector defect.

        That reuse is safe because nothing downstream mutates a ``Placement``

        composer.  A refusal verdict recorded against a shared shape may
        therefore NAME A SIBLING BLOCK'S INDEX rather than the one it is
        attached to; that is a cosmetic cost this sharing accepts, not a
        correctness one. ``nogood`` additionally skips a

        higher, without even building its sub-spec. Returns remembered
