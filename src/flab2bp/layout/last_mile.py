# src/flab2bp/layout/last_mile.py
"""A bounded, complete last-mile search over a small conflict cluster.

The rip-up-and-reroute loop in :func:`flab2bp.layout.freeform._route_all` is
greedy sequential routing with a displacement repair.  When it finishes with a
net or two still unrouted it has proved nothing: the pack is discarded and the
only thing that survives is decaying feedback.  This module is the missing
proof.  Given the handful of nets that failed and the nets their blame walls
accuse, it searches JOINTLY over all of them -- conflict-based search, with the
router's own geometric search at the low level -- and returns one of exactly three answers:
a disjoint routing for every cluster net, a closed tree that proves there is
none, or "a bound fired and nothing is claimed".

NOTHING HERE IMPORTS ``freeform`` AT RUNTIME.  Every canvas, grid and net type
is behind ``TYPE_CHECKING`` and every capability the search needs arrives as a
callable on :class:`ClusterEnvironment`, because ``_route_all``'s ends, stake,
unstake and blocker machinery are closures over one routing pass and cannot be
imported.  (``route_feedback`` IS a runtime import -- the ``BUDGET`` rule
compares against :class:`RouteFailureKind`, and that module imports nothing
from here, so there is no cycle.)
That also makes the whole module testable on hand-built grids.

    a splitter", and omitting it keeps the caller's older behaviour exactly.
    It exists because a cluster is built out of nets the caller has UNSTAKED,
    and unstaking is what makes two nets on one source lane look independent.
    ``_ends`` offers a net the lane's direct access cells only when no sibling
    has taken the lane yet; with both siblings released, both are offered the
    SAME cells, CBS hands each a different one, calls the two routings
    disjoint -- and the committer then refuses the second with
    ``junction-collider``, because a lane whose splitter site is blocked can be
    left directly by ONE net and no more.  Measured on
    ``universe-matrix/output-products``, cluster ``(36, 37)``: one shared source
