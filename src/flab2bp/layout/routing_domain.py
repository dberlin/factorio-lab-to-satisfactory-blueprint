#: Free tiles reserved on a strip's WEST face -- a routing channel the model
#: pays for, rather than a corridor the router hopes to find.
#:
#: THIS IS THE ROUTABILITY CONSTRAINT.  Every net starts at an output lane's
#: EAST end and finishes at an input lane's WEST head (see ``_emit_strip``), and
#: both of those tiles are walled in on three sides by their own strip: a lane's
#: neighbours above and below are the next lane or the machine band, and the
#: fourth neighbour is the lane itself.  A port therefore has exactly ONE way in
#: or out, the tile on its own strip's east or west face, and
#: ``_reserve_port_access`` holds precisely that tile.
#:
#: With a margin on the east face alone, a strip's east margin column IS the
#: column its eastern neighbour's input heads open onto -- one channel serving
#: two faces.  ``add_no_overlap_2d`` is satisfied, the pack is legal and tight,
#: and two ports fight over one cell; the loser is handed an EMPTY start or goal
#: set and the geometric search reports dynamic access loss having expanded nothing.  That is not
#: congestion and no amount of rip-up can price it away, which is why more solver
#: time made this WORSE: a tighter pack is a pack with more faces pressed
#: together.
#:
#: Measured before this existed, with every unserved port's four neighbours
#: classified: on ``casimir-crystal/no-proliferator`` three ports were boxed in,
#: each by two lane belts, one machine and -- on the one open side -- a cell
#: another port had already claimed.  Every one of them was the shared-column
#: collision.
#:
#: One column, not two: one is what makes the two faces' access cells DISJOINT,
#: which is the whole property.  It costs one tile of width per column of the
#: pack, and it is the cheapest form of "reserve the channel in the model" that
#: the ports actually need.
WEST_CHANNEL = 1


# A SECOND ROW on the south face was tried here and is not worth having.
#
# The reasoning was symmetric to `WEST_CHANNEL`: the corridor between two
# vertically adjacent strips is one row tall, a strip's machine band blocks every
# level, so that row is the only east-west way past a strip and one belt fills
# it.  Widening it to two measured WORSE -- 59/72 clean at 4s against 60/72 --
# because a row costs height on every strip in the pack, the canvas grows, the geometric search
# slows, and the sweep reaches fewer candidate heights inside the same deadline.
# The channel it buys is not free and the heights it costs were paying more.
#
# The west channel is not the same trade and that is the point: it makes two
# ports' access cells DISJOINT, which is a property the router cannot recover by
# searching harder.  A wider corridor only makes an existing search easier.

#: Height of one routing level, in blueprint world units.  Derived rather than
#: written as ``1`` so it stays tied to the two measured constants it is made

#: Toll a path pays per tile for occupying GROUND LEVEL.
#:
#: A belt at z=0 leaves z=1 and z=2 open above it -- only a machine denies all

#: (:func:`_crossing_ban_levels`) -- but a plain step costs 1 and a ramp 3, so the
#: geometric search has
#: no reason to climb and never does unless it is blocked.  The whole block
#: therefore wires on one plane, and a route that crosses it CUTS that plane:
#: ramping over a belt needs two free tiles of run on each side, and a dense
#: pack has not got them.  Measured on ``universe-matrix`` at h=92, where 36% of
#: every failed search's wall was another net's committed path and the largest
#: sealed pocket held 35,105 cells -- half the canvas, walled off by belts.
#:
#: A toll on ground level makes altitude worth buying for THROUGH traffic while
#: leaving it unattractive for short hops.  A run of length L pays L*(1+t) on
#: the ground against roughly L+6 in the air, so it climbs once L exceeds 6/t
#: and not before -- which is the trade wanted, because ports are on the ground
#: and must stay reachable across it.

#: full cost and changes no decision, measures 66/65/65 clean over the corpus
#: against 65/66/65 with the census switched off entirely.  The walk is free;
#: what costs is what you do with it.
_BLAME_MAX_POCKET = 32_768

#: Largest WALL a failed search will charge anybody for.
#:
#: THIS is what makes the surcharge shippable, and the reasoning is about guilt
#: rather than about time.  A search that dies in a pocket walled by three cells
#: has named three suspects; one of them really did cut this net off.  A search
#: that dies in a pocket walled by three thousand has named no one -- it is
#: describing the whole corridor network, and charging all of it just makes
#: every route longer.
#:
#: Measured, and the split is clean.  Charging every wall regardless of size
#: gives 62-66 clean over thirteen runs, mean 65.0, against 65-66 over nine runs
#: with no surcharge at all: the occasional four-cell loss is a round where
#: diffuse blame sent half the block on a detour and the sweep ran out of clock.
#: Capping it gives 64-66, mean 65.4, while keeping the whole of the gain --
#: `universe-matrix/no-proliferator` at h=69 commits 139 of its 140 paths
#: without the surcharge and ALL 140 with it, capped or not, and routes in 24.6s
#: instead of 36.7s.  The diffuse walls contributed nothing but variance.
#:
#: The capped-versus-off comparison is INTERLEAVED, alternating the two settings
#: run by run rather than measuring one block then the other, because
#: `validate.py` was being edited in the tree at the time and `_sweep` calls
#: `validate.certify` inside its own clock -- a faster validator leaves more
#: seconds for routing and would have looked like a routing result.  Six pairs,
#: with the validator's mtime checked either side to confirm it held still: off
#: 66/64/65/66/65/65, mean 65.2; on 66/65/65/65/65/66, mean 65.3.  INVALID 0 in
#: all twelve.  This buys the h=69 pack and costs nothing, which is the whole
#: case for it -- it is not a corpus win and should not be sold as one.
_BLAME_MAX_WALL = 64

#: What a wall cell costs, in units of the plain per-round history point.
#:
#: The plain term charges one point for having been used at all, which after a
#: few rounds of the geometric pressure ramp is worth a couple of tiles of
#: detour.  A cell that cut the board in two has to be worth more than that or
#: the net holding it simply keeps it.  Forty is where the h=69 pack tips:
#: weights 0 and 12 leave one net with no path at all and 40 leaves none, and 80
#: buys nothing further.
_BLAME_WEIGHT = 40.0

#: Rings of ground reserved around the packed block, decided BEFORE anything
#: routes.
#:
#: The block's boundary used to MOVE during emission while several passes each
#: assumed it was fixed: the external input runs computed the edge, ran out to
#: it and thereby moved it; the router was then free to lay belts two tiles
#: beyond that, wrapping the runs that had just defined it; the proliferator
#: entry was placed one tile west of whatever the edge happened to be at that
#: moment.  Every entry lane the validator reported as walled in was a tile that
#: had been on the boundary when it was placed and interior by the time the
#: placement was finished.
#:
#: Fixing the extent up front removes the whole class.  ``_ENTRY_RING`` is the
#: outermost ring anything may occupy, and only external entry belts -- the
#: input runs and the proliferator entry -- are ever placed there.  Everything
#: else, the router and the power lattice included, is confined to
#: ``_ROUTE_RING`` by :attr:`_Canvas.limit`.  The ring one beyond
#: ``_ENTRY_RING`` is therefore empty by construction, which is exactly the
#: precondition ``flow.external_entry_reachable`` flood-fills for: a belt
#: sitting on the outermost occupied ring always has open ground on its outward
#: side.
#:
#: Two rings for the router rather than one: that is what it had before on the
#: west and north faces, so the fix costs it no freedom there.
_ROUTE_RING = 2
_ENTRY_RING = _ROUTE_RING + 1


# THERE IS NO FALLBACK PACKING HERE, AND THERE MUST NOT BE ONE.
#
# This has now been built and deleted TWICE: once as `fallback_placement`
# reachable from `lay_out`, and once as `_loose_sweep`, a shelf packing at
# progressively wider margins tried after every solved pack failed to wire.
# The second came with a self-check -- it only returned placements that had
# routed with every net connected -- and the self-check is exactly what made it
# look defensible. It is not.
#
# A check proves the fallback's output is not broken. It says nothing about why
# the solved path had nothing to hand back, and that is the only question worth
# asking: a spec that reaches a fallback has a PACKER PRODUCING PACKS ITS OWN
# ROUTER CANNOT WIRE. Emitting the shelf packing makes that defect invisible --
# the cell goes green, the audit says CLEAN, and nobody looks again.
#
# And it is paid for in the one currency this program exists to minimise.
# Measured on `casimir-crystal/no-proliferator`: solved packs of 4960-6120 tiles
# that did not route, against a shelf packing of 8786-11628 that did. Buying a
# green cell at twice the area is not a rescue, it is the failure being paid for
# in density. Spine measured the same shape, 50,512 tiles against ~39,000.
#
# An unwireable pack is a REFUSAL. If that number is worse, it is the true
# number, and the fix belongs in the PACKER -- routability as a constraint the
# model respects, not a post-hoc test with a rescue behind it.

# AND THERE IS NO TOWER LATTICE HERE EITHER, FOR THE SAME REASON.
#
# Power used to be a square lattice of spacing 9, each point dragged to the
# nearest free cell within four, with a coverage repair after routing for every
# tile the result left dark. The spacing was justified exactly: 9/sqrt(2) = 6.36
# to the worst-placed tile, plus 4 of displacement, is 10.36 against a 10.5
# radius. The repair was not justified at all, and it is the half that decided
# whether a build shipped.
#
# A dark tile is repairable only if some cell of its 346-cell radius is still
# free, and by the time the repair runs the packing and the router have both had
# the ground. When they have taken all of it the repair searches, finds nothing,
# and returns quietly -- so the placement fails `power.coverage` and the whole
# candidate is discarded, having paid for a pack AND a full routing pass first.
# Measured on `information-matrix`: a matrix lab with 349 tiles inside tower
# range had FOUR of them free.
#
# A solution that cannot be powered is not feasible. So `_power_plan` decides
# coverage BEFORE anything routes, refuses the pack outright when no placement
# exists, and covers by need rather than by grid -- which is also 2-4x fewer
# towers, because a lattice point every nine tiles ignores that a tower reaches
# 10.5 in every direction.

    #: fit -- the only recipe in the dataset where the true bound binds.

    #: The east face is the way out, and the OUTPUT is what goes there, because
    #: an output MERGES and an input would have to split.  Each machine drops its
    #: product east into a one-tile belt in the gap beside it; those gap belts run
    #: south and join the output row under the band, which is where it always was.
    #: Several belts feeding one is a thing a belt does; one belt feeding several
    #: is a splitter, and the no-splitter invariant is what buys the whole
    #: lane-per-destination design.
    #:
    #: The gap is bought, not found: ``pw`` is the machine's clearance PLUS ONE

    #: starts the south inputs at offset 0; False keeps the pre-2026-09-07 map
    #: exactly -- drain innermost, inputs pushed out by ``len(out_lanes)``.
    #:
    #: The drain may have that row because it carries NO SORTER: ``_flank_lane``
    #: puts the only sorter on the machine's east face and runs a gap belt south
    #: into the lane.  ``_side_lane_caps`` counts a CONTIGUOUS run outward from
    #: the band, so the row past ``below_cap`` has no ``attachable_columns`` at
    #: all -- fine for a drain, useless to an input.  ``sorter_span`` therefore
    #: returns 0 for it BY DESIGN, and ``_machines_without_poses`` already skips
    #: flanked strips.
    #:
    #: Derived once, in ``_logical_strip_plans``, by
    #: ``strip_variants._drain_moves_outermost``: flanked, ``below_cap > 0``,
    #: and ``len(in_below) == below_cap``.  A spec that never needed the freed
    #: row keeps today's seating and today's area, which is the user's ruling in
    #: spec §9 R2.  A side with NO reachable row is not "filled" -- ``0 == 0``
    #: would say it was, and there is nothing to push the drain past.
    #:
    #: IT ALSO CAPS THE FAMILY AT ONE MACHINE PER STRIP, in
    #: ``generate_strip_families``, and the reason is a belt column rather than
    #: a rate: ``_flank_lane``'s gap belt runs down the column east of its OWN
    #: machine, so with the drain outermost it crosses every south input lane
    #: and ``geom.belt_single_occupancy`` convicts the result.  Only the last
    #: machine in a strip has a clear gap column.  That cap turns
    #: ``universe-matrix#37`` into 15 one-machine strips.  It used
    #: to refuse there, on ``_fanout_shortfall``'s theory that each consumer taps
    #: a different TILE of the producer lane; that theory was measured wrong --
    #: nets sharing a source lane branch off each other's committed paths
    #: (``_route``'s ``same_src``), and a 10-tile lane wired all twelve of its
    #: consumers.  See ``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-09-07-lane-fanout-design.md``

        or a junction on them is illegal against the machine beside it.

        The two were the same number until spacing landed, so every consumer

    The south face of a lane-fed machine offers three columns and so does the
    north, and ``universe-matrix`` wants seven connections.  This is where the
    seventh comes from: the product leaves by the east face instead of the south,
    which hands the whole south face back to the ingredients.

    Geometry, per machine:

    * a belt stands in the column one past the machine's CLEARANCE -- ``pw - 1``
      from its west edge, with ``pw`` already bought a column wider for exactly
      this.  Inside the clearance the game's own collider check would call it a
      collision;
    * a sorter runs from the machine's lowest free east pose into that belt;
    * the belt runs SOUTH to the output lane under the band and joins it.

    JOINING, NOT SPLITTING, IS WHY THE OUTPUT IS WHAT GETS FLANKED.  A belt tile
    takes several feeders and has one successor, so several gap belts draining
    into one output lane is a shape a belt makes natively.  An ingredient would
    have to go the other way -- one lane feeding a gap belt per machine -- and
    that is a splitter per machine, which is the invariant a lane per destination
    exists to keep.

    A machine whose east slots are all spoken for is SKIPPED, silently and
    beltless, exactly as ``_link_lane`` skips one whose columns are.  It is not a
    fallback: an unwired product is what the flow checks convict, so the
    placement is refused rather than shipped short.  The belt is laid only after
    the slot is secured, so a skip leaves no orphan belt behind either.

        if (!history.beltVerticalConstruction && num25 > 0.8f)
            buildPreview2.condition = EBuildCondition.TooSteep;

    A ramp is any slope inside ``MAX_BELT_SLOPE``; the vertical form is simply
    the case where the run is zero, which is infinite slope and needs the
    ``beltVerticalConstruction`` unlock.  There is no height threshold
    selecting between them, and no cap on how high a ramp may climb -- the only
    ceiling is ``buildMaxHeight``, and ``catalog.belt_max_z`` carries it.

    So an earlier reading here -- that the game picks by height, from the user's
    "at lower heights it does a ramp" -- described a consequence, not the rule:
    at low heights a ramp is available and cheaper in materials, and above the
    slope limit only the vertical form remains.  Both readings predict the same
    blueprints; only the source distinguishes them.

    This router emits RAMP always.  A blueprint-z rise of
    ``BELT_CLIMB_PER_TILE`` over one tile is a world slope of ``2/3``, inside
    the paste path's ``3/4`` limit, at ANY altitude, so the ramp needs no unlock
    and is always available.

    .. note::
       **The vertical form is a real density lever and is deliberately NOT
       built.**  With ``beltVerticalConstruction`` a level change costs ZERO
       horizontal tiles instead of ``RAMP_TILES_PER_LEVEL``, and the user's own
       save has the tech -- their max-height blueprint climbs ``z = 0 -> 38`` in
       38 steps, none of which moves.  Every crossing this router makes
       currently spends two tiles going up and two coming down; on the vertical
       form that is four tiles returned per crossing, and there were 8 to 28
       level changes per generated blueprint.

       Not built here because it is a ROUTING change -- A\* would need a
       zero-run move, and the reservation and profile both assume a climb
       occupies tiles -- and this branch is already carrying the emission fix,
       the slope rule and the technology plumbing.  It also only applies to
       saves that have the tech, so it cannot replace the ramp, only beat it

    **This is the level-index -> world-altitude boundary.**  The router walks an
    integer lattice; :class:`PlacedBuilding` stores tiles of height.  Handing a
    lattice index straight to the encoder is what shipped belts the game drew
    red -- a chain that read ``0, 0, 1, 1`` climbed a whole tile of height in
    one tile of run, twice as fast as a belt can, with no tile at ``1/2`` where
    every real elevated run has one.

    A level change already costs the router two tiles: the A\* ramp edge
    reserves a *via* cell one step along, at the OLD level, before landing on
    the new level two steps along.  Both are already in ``path``, so
    materialising the ramp costs **no extra tiles** -- the via cell's altitude
    was wrong, not its existence.  The cell that needs the half value is the one
    whose successor sits on a different level, which is exactly that via cell::

        levels    0     0     0     0     1     1     1     0     0

    Matching the corpus, where every elevated run reads
    ``0.0, 0.5, 1.0, ... 1.0, 0.5, 0.0``.  Per the user that shape is forced
    rather than stylistic: a belt at ``1/2`` still fouls one at ``0``, so a
    crossing has to be a full level up and the climb has to start two tiles out.

    ``1/2`` is a legal RESTING altitude too, not only a ramp tile -- the corpus
    has runs up to 23 tiles long at that height -- so a profile is not required
    to pass straight through it.

    hashed by identity, whose four neighbours and eight ramp targets are reached
    by ADDING a precomputed offset rather than by building a tuple.

    ``occ`` folds ``bounds``, ``blocked``, ``solid`` and ``keep_out`` into one
    byte per cell, so :func:`_geometric_search`'s neighbour test is a single indexed read
    where it used to be four hashed probes and two tuple builds.  ``reserved``
    is kept OUT of it and applied per call, because which reservations a net may
    use depends on ``canvas.routing_ports``, which is rebound for every net.

    ``base`` is ``occ`` as it stood before any path was committed.  Rip-up
    restores from it rather than writing 1, because a ripped cell is not
    necessarily free -- it may sit outside ``bounds``, which a start cell is
    allowed to do.  Restoring the byte it actually had cannot get that wrong.

    THE LAYOUT IS X-MAJOR ON PURPOSE.  ``heapq`` breaks a tie on ``(f, cost)`` by
    comparing the third element, so the cell's own ordering decides which of two
    equal-cost paths is taken.  ``x``, then ``y``, then ``lvl`` makes integer
    order the SAME total order as tuple order, so every tie falls the way it did
    when cells were tuples.  A level-major index -- the obvious layout -- is
    measurably a different router: injected as a fault it left the expansion
    count byte-identical and moved the committed paths.

    ``span`` is the indexed extent and is padded two cells beyond anything the
    search may touch, because a ramp travels two tiles and index arithmetic from
    a passable cell must land inside the array rather than wrapping into the next

    The fixed term contains only distinct template belts named by a non-belt

    remove such a belt during boundary cleanup without leaving that reference
    invalid.  The route term is computed from the actual prepared nets: direct
    insertions are already absent, and prelinked piler transitions are ignored.

    Each net pays the unobstructed planar Manhattan distance between every
    access cell its prepared source-sharing group may legally use and every
    access cell its destination-sharing group may legally use, including both
    endpoint cells.  External nets use their prepared boundary goals.  Altitude,
    obstacles, ramps, and access restrictions are deliberately ignored, so they
    can only make an accepted route longer.  Nets joined by ``src_group`` or
    ``dst_group`` form one legal-sharing component and pay only that component's
    maximum floor; unrelated components add because the detailed router forbids
    their route cells from being reused.

    Thus ``total <= finalized belt_tiles`` for every validator-clean placement
    emitted from ``problem``.  This says nothing about unprepared placements,

    Two belts feeding one is a side merge, which the game allows and
    ``_build_runs`` already models (a tile with two predecessors heads its own
    run).  Reaching a sibling's belt is therefore as good as reaching the lane
    it feeds, and it is the ONLY option when the lane itself is walled in.

    The sibling's own cells are not offered as goals: they are occupied, so the geometric search
    could never step onto them.  Their free neighbours are what a merging belt
    actually needs.

    ``junctionable`` IS THE SOURCE SIDE ONLY, and it is the difference between
    offering a merge point and offering a merge point that can be built.
    Leaving a sibling's path puts a SPLITTER on the cell left from, because that
    cell already flows onward; a splitter's cross collider needs three and a
    half tiles from an Assembling Machine's centre, and a path running beside a
    machine band offers plenty of cells at 2.83.  Without the filter the geometric search takes
    the cheapest of those, ``_tap_source`` refuses the site at commit time, and
    the whole pack is discarded for a tap that was never legal -- with the
    router blamed for a route it was told to make.

    The DESTINATION side passes nothing, and that is not an oversight: arriving
    at a sibling's path builds no junction at all, only a link from this path's
    tail (see ``_sink_for``), so no site has to be clear.

    THE BELT HALF IS ASKED HERE TOO, and it is asked here rather than at commit
    time for the reason the backlog entry records: a site test inside
    ``_commit_paths`` cannot see a belt that has not been staked yet, and
    tightening it there only starves the router of taps.  A junction denies
    :func:`junction.keepout_cells` to any belt that is not on its own run, so a
    sibling's cell whose keep-out already holds a FOREIGN belt is not a merge
    point that can be built -- and withdrawing it costs the router one of the
    several cells a frontier offers, where refusing at commit time costs the
    whole pack.

    ``belt_prefab`` makes that source-side proof include physical Splitter port
    identity.  A ramp and a branch may occupy different routing levels in the
    same compass direction, but they still name one port.  Such a neighbour is
    withheld here so the geometric search can choose another side instead of discovering the
    duplicate only after every path has been committed.

    ``owned_guard`` maps an exact reserved branch dock to the sibling tap that
    owns it.  A selected future Splitter guards that dock from unrelated nets,
    but its own source siblings must be able to begin there.  Requiring both
    dock and tap identity prevents the exception from opening any other cell in
    the Splitter's keep-out.

    ``source_choices`` retains competing tap identities until the endpoint
    owner can certify them before collapsing provenance. Unambiguous offers
    may defer projected-frame admission to the chosen-path search.

        `universe-matrix` that costs 3.1-4.0s a round to shuffle one or two
        failures about, and the sweep's whole ceiling buys three or four of them.

        What the failure IS, every time it has been looked at, is contention and
        never geometry.  Re-searching each stranded net on a grid where settled
        belts are passable found a path for all 31 stranded nets across five
        packs, in 0.001-0.025s each, and every one crossed between 1 and 11 of
        the 93-140 paths already down.  So: take that path, rip up only the
        handful it crosses, and send those looking again.  It is aimed at the
        nets that are actually in the way rather than at all of them, and it is
        roughly twenty-five times cheaper than the round it saves.

        This is also the overuse signal negotiation never had here.  A settled
        path is `blocked` rather than dear, so two nets never overlap and the
        history term can only ever record that a cell was USED.  A crossing
        search is the one place this router learns that a cell was WANTED by

        2's world is at least as loose as every world the packer could realise
        for these nets at this arrangement.  Looser than needed only weakens
        the cut; TIGHTER makes it forbid placements that work.  Three things
        are loosened, and each was a way for run 2 to come out tighter:

        - Every net is unstaked, so no path, `_TENTATIVE` cell, conditional
          guard or owner survives.
        - Every port corridor is retired (`_open_every_corridor`), because
          unstaking RE-RESERVES the corridors staked nets had retired.
        - `planned_taps` starts EMPTY and only the cluster's own taps
          accumulate, because those are the only taps every realizable world
          has.  Run 1's table is saved and put back afterwards.  Three of
          `_can_junction`'s four uses of that table get TIGHTER as it grows --
          the frame-ban scan, the `len(planned_here) >= 2` cap and the
          collider scan -- so keeping run 1's taps would over-constrain run 2.
          The fourth use, the conditional-guard refusal, gets tighter as the
          table SHRINKS, so `relaxed_junctions` exempts run 2 from that one.

        The relaxation also needs every routing-derived constraint gone: four
        of the five per-net rejection sets are read inside `_ends` and the
        fifth, `rejected_path_cells`, is the search's `forbidden` argument.
        All five are saved, emptied for the cluster's nets, and put back.

        Everything taken away is restored in the `finally` before
        `_restore_staked` re-stakes, so the `_round_state()` comparison sees

    can convict at most that many demands out of however many there are -- and
    a composed canvas raises 91 or 144 (v3 gate §5 lever 1).  Returning ``{}``
    there threw away a complete cell-disjoint assignment because a handful of
    its corridors failed a probe STRICTER than the router that follows: the
    probe forbids every other corridor's cells outright, while ``_route_all``
    negotiates and rips up.  So on give-up, ``survey`` -- which reports EVERY
    failing demand rather than the first -- is asked once, and what survives it
    is committed with ``converged=False``.  Dropping the failures can only free
    ground, so a corridor that reached its goal against the FULL selection
    still reaches it against the smaller one; the survivors need no re-check.
    Without a ``survey`` there is no way to know which corridors are safe, and
    the wholesale give-up is kept.

    Returns the indices of routed nets that could not be linked at commit time.

    ``src_group`` is the router's own record of which nets share each net's
    SOURCE LANE, and it is the only thing that can tell a legitimate branch from
    a mis-link. A path may leave a sibling's routed path or an already-selected
    prebuilt source tap in that same physical supply group. :func:`_source_for`
    is handed only those owned cells to attach to. Omitting that ownership
    lets any adjacent belt of the right item stand in for the source, which is
    how a short-cut net came to be fed by the very lane it was delivering to.

    ``dst_group`` is the same record for the DESTINATION lane, and
    :func:`_sink_for` needs it for the same reason.  A destination lane can be
    mixed -- several items delivered to one tile, which is what a matrix lab's
    input lane is -- so "an adjacent belt carrying my item" identifies neither
    the siblings that ARE going where this net is going nor the strangers that
    are not.  The router already decided the question when it offered those
    cells as goals; handing the answer to the linker is all this does.

    A belt tile has ONE ``output_obj``.  When a lane serves several consumers,
    the later nets branch off a sibling's committed path (``_route``'s
    ``same_src``) rather than off a further lane tile, and that branch point is
    a JUNCTION: the lane has to keep flowing east *and* hand items to the
    branch.  ``_tap_source`` builds that as a splitter, which is what the game
    uses and what the fixture corpus shows.

    Before splitters existed, every such net rewrote the same lane-end tile and
    the last to commit won silently.  The earlier paths stayed on the grid as
    belts nothing fed: real buildings, real area, no items.

    THE BELTS ALL GO DOWN BEFORE ANY TAP IS TAKEN, and that ordering is the
    whole reason this is two loops rather than one.  A junction's collider
    reaches a tile further than the tile it shares, so whether a site is legal
    depends on what stands beside it -- and walking the nets once, staking and
    tapping each in turn, made a splitter for net A before net B's belts existed
    to be seen.  A site test in that order cannot be right in principle: it is
    asked a question whose answer has not been decided yet.  Staking first makes
    ``_tap_source``'s test a question about a finished arrangement.

    The mirror of :func:`_sink_for`.  A path that could not start beside its own
    lane was routed from a sibling's belt instead, and feeding it from
    ``net.src.belt`` regardless would name a building it is nowhere near.

    ``kin`` IS THE SIBLING SET THE ROUTER ACTUALLY OFFERED -- the cells of the
    paths in this net's ``src_group`` and selected prebuilt source taps in that
    same cargo/supply group. Honouring it keeps this branch on THIS net's source.
    ``prebuilt_sources`` preserves the declared feeder's building identity at
    those selected taps: emitting a Splitter adds co-located output stubs that
    overwrite the canvas cell owner but are not replacement source feeders.

    Without it the scan took the first adjacent belt carrying the right item,
    and at a merge point several do.  ``quantum-chip/free-proliferation``:
    ``titanium-glass`` shards into a four-machine and a three-machine strip,
    ``plane-filter`` into three lanes of 6/5/5, and the cyclic pairing gives the
    four-machine shard eleven consumers.  :func:`_connect_short_cuts` sees that
    island starve and buys exactly one extra net -- three-machine shard to the
    six-machine lane -- which is the only thing joining the two islands.  That
    net routed to a single tile beside its destination and was then fed from the
    belt of the FOUR-machine shard's net, which already delivered there.  A
    one-tile belt taking items from a lane and handing them back to the same
    lane: linked, adjacent, acyclic, carrying the right item, and worth nothing.
    Both source-side and sink-side counters read success, so ``failed`` was 0,
    the sweep accepted the pack, and the island the short-cut was bought to
    close stayed open -- 11 machines drawing 11/4 items/s of titanium-glass from
    the 16/7 four machines make.  Roughly one build in twenty-five, since it
    needs the pack to put the two paths side by side.

    A branch off a belt that does not lead back to our own lane is not a
    cheaper way to reach the source; it is a different source.  So the scan is
    restricted rather than merely reordered.

    ``None`` MEANS THIS PATH LEAVES FROM NOTHING, exactly as it does for
    :func:`_sink_for`, AND IT USED TO RETURN ``net.src.belt`` INSTEAD.
    -------------------------------------------------------------------------
    That fallback was kept because it was MEASURED DEAD -- over 264 audit cells
    this function was called 12,020 times, 11,620 taking the lane tap, 400 a
    sibling from ``kin``, and the fallback 0 -- and because the link it emits is
    at least loud: it crosses the map, so ``belt.link_adjacent`` reports it and
    ``certify`` turns the placement into a refusal rather than a bad build.

    IT IS NOT DEAD ANY MORE, and the count was stale rather than wrong.  When
    ``_repair`` displaced the very sibling a stranded net had just merged onto
    (fixed in the same commit as this), the fallback ran on
    ``universe-matrix/no-proliferator`` power=1 EVERY RUN, and the pack it broke
    reported ``failed = 0``: the source side was linked, to a belt 15 tiles west
    and two altitude levels down.  Refused two layers later by our own
    validator, on ``belt.link_adjacent`` and ``geom.altitude_step``, with the
    packer blamed for a pack that had wired perfectly well.

    So it fails closed.  A path that leaves from nothing is unrouted, saying so
    counts it in ``unlinked``, and the router gets to try again inside the same
    routing pass -- which is what happens for every other kind of routing
    failure and what ``_sink_for`` has done since ``3f04239``.  The asymmetry
    was the last of it.

    """What this path actually reached: the lane head, or a sibling to merge into.

    A path that could not get to the lane head was routed to a sibling's belt
    instead (see ``_merge_frontier``), so linking it to ``net.dst.belt``
    regardless would name a building it is nowhere near -- which
    ``belt.link_adjacent`` would then, correctly, report as an error.

    Preference order is the lane head first, so the common case is unchanged and
    a merge only happens where one was actually routed.

    ``kin`` IS THE SIBLING SET THE ROUTER ACTUALLY OFFERED -- the cells of the
    paths in this net's ``dst_group``, the nets delivering to the SAME lane tile
    -- exactly as ``_source_for`` takes the source-lane siblings.  It replaces a
    scan for "an adjacent belt carrying my item", which was wrong in both
    directions on ``universe-matrix``:

    * IT REFUSED MERGES THE ROUTER HAD AIMED AT.  A destination lane can be
      MIXED, and the validator says so in as many words -- ``_entry_items``
      documents an entry lane labelled ``antimatter`` down its whole length
      while sorters draw both ``antimatter`` and ``electromagnetic-matrix`` off
      it.  ``_merge_frontier`` offers the free cells beside a sibling's path as
      goals without consulting items, because sharing a destination tile is what
      makes a sibling; A\\* then ends the path on one of those cells; and this
      function threw it away because the sibling's belt was labelled with the
      OTHER item of the pair.  All seven unlinked paths on
      ``universe-matrix/max-proliferation`` at budget 4 were this, and each one
      was adjacent to exactly one dst-sibling cell: ``information-matrix`` beside
      ``structure-matrix`` into (106,20), ``antimatter`` beside
      ``electromagnetic-matrix`` into (106,18) and (78,33), ``gravity-matrix``
      beside ``energy-matrix`` into (106,19).  A ``carries_item`` label is one
      of the items a mixed run holds, so it cannot answer "is this belt going
      where I am going".
    * IT ADMITTED MERGES NOBODY OFFERED.  An adjacent belt carrying our item
      that is not a sibling runs to a DIFFERENT consumer, and handing it our
      items delivers them there -- the sink-side twin of the ``_source_for``
      defect fixed in ``00d1f78``, where "the first adjacent belt carrying the
      right item" fed a net from the very lane it was delivering to.

    So the scan is restricted rather than merely reordered, on the same argument:
    a belt that does not lead to our own lane is not a cheaper way to reach the
    destination, it is a different destination.  Measured before the restriction
    was made: over three instrumented builds of the target cell every merge that
    already succeeded was a ``kin`` cell (4/4, 5/5, 6/6) and NO merge was made to
    a non-sibling belt, so this drops nothing that was working.

    ``None`` means this path reached NOTHING it can hand items to, and that is a
    route failure like any other.  It used to return ``net.dst.belt`` anyway, on
    the reasoning that a wrong link is at least visible as ``belt.link_adjacent``
    -- but visible to WHOM.  ``_commit_paths`` counted only source-side failures,
    so the sink-side break came back as ``failed = 0``, the sweep accepted the
    pack as fully wired, and the defect surfaced two layers later as a
    placement our own validator threw out.  Measured on
    ``universe-matrix/free-proliferation`` at 120s, where the emitted block
    carried three belts linking to a lane head 35 to 40 tiles away and three more
    stepping two altitude levels in one tile.

    A net that reached nothing is unrouted.  Saying so lets the sweep discard
    that height and try another, which is what it does for every other kind of
    routing failure.
    ``protected_targets`` names source-Splitter branch heads whose emitted stub
    must remain their only predecessor. Adding a destination merge there would
    make the reverse input depend on last-writer ordering. Ordinary sibling
    merges are unaffected.

    Raises :class:`_Unpowerable` when this pack cannot be powered at all, which
    is a property of the PACK and makes it infeasible.  Otherwise it returns a
    placement that covers every powered tile and is connected, and the cells are
    held in ``canvas.keep_out`` so the router paths around them.

    ``demand`` is the complete route-capable envelope. ``additional_demand``
    names known powered junctions outside that envelope without pessimistically
    powering the entire belt-only entry ring. ``canvas.limit`` is the boundary
    where towers may stand.

    WHY THIS IS A PLAN AND NOT A LATTICE WITH A REPAIR BEHIND IT
    ------------------------------------------------------------
    This used to lay a fixed square lattice of spacing ``TOWER_SPACING``, drag
    each point to the nearest free cell, and then, after routing, hunt for
    somewhere to stand for every tile the result had left dark.  That last pass
    is the problem, and it cannot be fixed where it stands: a dark tile is
    repairable only if some cell of its radius is still free, and by then the
    packing and the routing have both had the ground.  When they have taken all
    of it the repair searches its 346 cells, finds none, and silently gives up
    -- the placement then fails ``power.coverage`` and the whole candidate is
    thrown away, having paid for a pack AND a full routing pass first.

    A solution that cannot be powered is not feasible, so the question is asked
    HERE, where the answer is still cheap and still true:

    * **Feasibility is a test, not a hope.**  A cover exists if and only if
      every powered tile has at least one free cell within the radius.  That is
      checked directly, first, and a pack that fails it is refused before a
      single belt is routed.
    * **Greedy attains it whenever it holds.**  Every round places a tower on
      the free cell that covers the most still-dark tiles, so every round makes
      progress, and the loop ends only when nothing is dark.  There is no case
      where it stops early with work left over, which is precisely the case the
      repair pass existed to mop up.
    * **Connectivity is built in.**  After the first tower every candidate must
      lie within ``connect_distance`` of one already placed, so the network is
      connected at every step rather than stitched together afterwards.  When
      nothing in range covers anything new, a RELAY is placed -- the in-range
      cell closest to what is still dark.  That is the network walking to the
      far side of the block, not a repair of a network that failed.

    It is also much smaller than the lattice it replaces, which is a density
    win rather than a tidiness one.  A lattice point every nine tiles ignores
    that a tower reaches 10.5 in every direction; covering by need instead of by
    grid measured 75 towers against 350 on ``universe-matrix``
    /free-proliferation, 106 against 407 on its ``no-proliferator``, and 16-27
    against 32-72 across five ``casimir-crystal`` packs.  Every tower deleted is
    a building the player does not paste AND a cell the router gets back.

    The tie-break is deliberate and it points AWAY from the router's corridors:
    among cells that cover equally many dark tiles, the one with the MOST free
    neighbours wins, because a cell in the middle of a wide field can be taken
    without disconnecting anything while a cell in a one-row channel cannot.
    It used to point the other way, which is measured at three corpus cells --
    see the tie-break itself, where the numbers are.

        # could still shrink to, taken before a single tower existed. Standing
        # one here makes the build at least as large as `candidate_bounds`, and
        # a band whose frame cannot hold that rectangle is a paste this
        # candidate can never be part of -- so a paste rule tested there
        # rejects a site on the geometry of a blueprint that would not contain
        # it.
        #
        # That is not a corner case, it is the five-machine hole. A one-strip
        # block's survivors are four rows tall, so the whole 5-row half of the
        # planet is still in the envelope; a tower one row outside them makes
        # the build six rows tall and rules every one of those bands out. Left
        # unnarrowed, `game.power_too_close` in band 4 -- where a longitude
        # collapses to a point, so ANY two nodes are zero units apart -- vetoed
        # nearly every free cell, the greedy ran out of ground with the block's
        # west corner still dark, and both placers refused specs of exactly 5
        # and 6 machines while 4 and 7 laid out.
        #
        # The static-collision check below has always narrowed to exactly this
        # rectangle. The power-node check now does too, from the same bounds.
        #
        # "NARROWING" HOLDS ONLY WHEN `canvas.limit` IS SET.  The per-candidate
        # envelope below is `_projection_envelope(candidate_bounds,
        # canvas.limit or candidate_bounds, ...)`, and `projections` was taken
        # as `_projection_envelope(cleanup_inner, canvas.limit or occupied,
        # ...)`. With a limit the two share that outer box and the candidate's
        # inner rectangle only grew, so the candidate set is a SUBSET of
        # `projections`. Production always has one: `_prepare_routing_problem`
        # assigns `canvas.limit = capacity` (~16740) before it plans power.
        # With `limit=None` -- which only a caller that builds its own canvas
        # reaches, such as the `_power_plan` tests -- the outer box collapses to
        # the inner one on both sides, so the candidate envelope is the
        # projections of the SINGLE rectangle `candidate_bounds` and is not a
        # subset of `projections` at all: `candidate_bounds` can extend past
        # `occupied`, and the extents in between are never enumerated.

    comparison is ``dx2**2 + dy2**2 <= floor((2r)**2)`` -- exact, because the

    not a tolerance and there is no float anywhere near it.

    A site that is no longer free is a ``keep_out`` that did not hold, which is

    :func:`_power_plan` decides a whole block's network BEFORE routing, from an
    envelope, and that is the right shape for a block: the pack is known, the
    ground is free, and a tower planned there is held in ``keep_out`` until it
    is stood.  A COMPOSED canvas cannot be planned that way, and the reason is
    not tidiness.  Each block arrives with its own network already built and
    sized for its own footprint; what the composition ADDS is belts (unpowered)
    and the Splitters :func:`_commit_paths` creates at taps -- and where a tap
    lands is decided by the router, on ground that only exists once the blocks
    are packed.  Planning the composed envelope before routing would either
    re-plan 61 towers that are already correct or blanket the gap with towers
    for tiles nothing will ever occupy.

    Coverage is planned after ``_route_all`` from what is actually there, not
    from the empty space between blocks. Existing covering nodes may belong to
    separate networks even when no tile is dark. After coverage, legal relays
    grow the first component toward the nearest stranded component, using the
    same finite greedy walk as :func:`_power_plan`. The canvas and the caller's
    cancellation clock bound that walk; no existing building is moved.

    Legality rules, all consulted rather than restated:

    * **Coverage** uses the doubled-integer predicate ``validate._coverage``
      and :func:`_place_power` use, so this pass and the validator cannot
      disagree about a radius.
    * **``game.power_too_close``** -- no site inside
      ``rules.power_node_keepout_offsets`` of any node already present, tower
      or mode-driven machine.
    * **``power.connectivity``** -- covering-node components and every new
      link use doubled centres and the maximum of the two link distances,
      exactly as ``validate._connectivity`` does.
    * **Projected geometry** -- the candidate and all previously chosen sites
      must share a legal reachable frame with the routed static objects,
      including exact power-pair spacing and Coater/Splitter clearances.

    Returns ``(sites, uncovered)``: ground coordinates for
    :func:`_place_power`, and the tiles no legal site could reach. If coverage
    succeeds but the networks cannot be joined, raises :class:`_Unpowerable`
    naming ``power.connectivity`` rather than inventing uncovered tiles.

    Pair the two sides cyclically so EVERY producer lane is drained and EVERY
    consumer lane is filled, whichever side was sharded further.  One net per
    side-pair; taking the cross product would emit needless belts.

    Every reuse of a lane stays on that lane's END TILE.  Walking inward was
    tried and is worse: a mid-lane tile is WALLED IN -- lane either side,
    machines above, another lane below -- so the branch it was meant to serve has
    nowhere to leave from.  Measured on the free-proliferation chain: three of
    the five walled-in ports were taps this had moved, each with all four
    neighbours occupied on a clean canvas.

    Sharing the end tile is safe because ``_tap_source`` builds a junction there:
    the first net links directly, the second turns the link into a splitter, and
    further nets attach to it until the four sides run out -- at which point it
    reports the failure instead of mis-linking.

    Only the PRODUCER side is ever reused this way.  Walking the consumer lane
    inward was tried and is strictly worse: a strip's inner input lane is walled
    in the same way, and only the lane HEAD is reachable because its west
    neighbour lies outside the strip.  So several producers feeding one consumer
    lane cannot each reach it -- they converge instead, the first net routing to
    the head and the rest merging into that net's path, which is what belts do
    anyway.

    ``out_rate`` and ``in_rate`` are the per-machine production and consumption
    of this item, and they are what :func:`_connect_short_cuts` needs to tell an
    island that balances from one that starves.  Omitting them keeps the pairing

    """Extra nets joining islands that cannot feed themselves.

    ``flow.conservation``'s placement clause is a CUT argument: within every
    island an item can physically travel across, production must cover
    consumption.  A one-to-one pairing cuts an item's flow graph into as many
    islands as it makes pairs, and each island then has to balance on its own --
    which two independent integer partitions cannot promise.  Measured on
    ``quantum-chip``: ``titanium-glass`` shards into a four-machine and a
    three-machine strip, ``plane-filter`` into sixteen machines across three
    lanes, and the cyclic pairing hands the four-machine shard eleven of them.
    That island needs 11/4 of a machine's output where seven machines covering
    sixteen reach only 16/7, and no routing inside the block can make it up.

    Connecting every such edge in full was built and measured and thrown away.
    Joining ``n + m`` lanes takes ``n + m - 1`` edges against the pairing's
    ``max(n, m)``, so doing it everywhere adds ``min(n, m) - 1`` nets to every
    sharded edge in the build; over the whole corpus at a 4s budget that removed
    the one ``flow.conservation`` cell and cost FOUR others -- 54 of 72 clean
    against 58 -- because the extra belts crowd both the router and the power
    lattice.

    So the join is bought only where it is needed.  The islands the cyclic
    pairing produced are costed against the actual per-machine rates, and if
    every one of them can feed itself nothing is added at all.  If any cannot,
    the islands are chained with one net apiece -- the whole edge becomes a
    single island and the spec's own arithmetic decides it, which is the only
    claim backpressure cannot rescue.

    # Power is decided AFTER the ports have claimed their ground, and before
    # anything routes.
    #
    # Both halves of that matter and they used to be one. Power claimed first,
    # on the argument that it is otherwise handed whatever a dense block has
    # left, which is nothing -- that argument is right and the claim stays ahead
    # of the router. But it also ran ahead of the SECOND `hold_ports`, which is
    # the one that sees the coater drops and the proliferator entry, and
    # `_reserve_port_access` clears and re-stakes every reservation when it
    # runs. So a tower cell could sit on a port's one open side and the re-stake
    # would find it gone.
    #
    # Measured on `casimir-crystal/max-proliferation`: twelve ports boxed in,
    # every one of them by a machine, two lane belts and a tower keep-out cell.
    # The two claims are not symmetric -- a tower has a whole radius of ground
    # to stand in and `_power_plan` picks from all of it, while a port with no
    # free neighbour has no second option at all and takes its net down with it.
    #
    # `_power_plan` RAISES when the pack cannot be powered, which is the whole
    # of the change: an unpowerable pack is infeasible, so it is refused here --
    # before a single belt is routed -- rather than emerging as a coverage
    # failure once the pack and the routing have both spent the ground.
    # Every source is an already materialized belt tile.  Leaving it may require
    # a Splitter even when only one logical net uses that exact tile: a
    # proliferator trunk, for example, already continues past each branch.

    Returns the exact promise only after emitting its sorter. ``None`` retains
    the unrealized promise as typed static-access evidence at the caller; it
    never restores the rewarded net as an ordinary belt route.

    **NOT ANY SHARED COLUMN WILL DO**, and this used to take the westmost one.
    A bridge is a BELT-TO-BELT sorter, so the game grows its collider by
    ``colliders.SORTER_END_EXTENSION`` past BOTH ends -- 0.7 units, more than
    half a tile, at each end -- while a sorter serving a machine grows at one
    end only.  Drop a bridge onto a column where a strip's own sorter already
    meets one of the two lanes and the two boxes intersect, which the game
    refuses with ``EBuildCondition.Collide``: sorter against sorter is the one
    pairing its excusal does not forgive.  That is the defect this argument
    exists for, reported from the game on a blueprint whose bridge landed on the
    same belt tile a smelter's output sorter was already using; see
    ``validate.game.sorter_collide``.

    ``standing`` is that answer prepared: the seated box of every sorter already
    placed, which the caller builds once and this extends.  Every shared column
    is tried, west to east, and the first one whose seated box clears them all
    is the one taken. When none does, the promise remains unrealized and the
    containing pack attempt fails with typed evidence.

    Flow order is the independent precondition.  The bridge must draw strictly
    after enough emitted source injections to cover ``required_rate`` and land
    strictly before every emitted pickup from its destination lane.  Waiting
    for later source surplus needlessly destroys compact valid alignments.
    Candidate geometry proves the same rate bound from the strip plan; repeating
    it from the emitted object links keeps a stale plan or emission drift from
    turning a rewarded bridge into starvation.

    Sprayed input lanes start ``west_channel`` cells west of the strip.  The
    machine-facing lane begins at index ``west_channel``, so that tile and every
    later one may already feed a machine.  Seating there would let that consumer
    take unsprayed cargo before it reaches the Coater.  Index zero is the routing
    turn and the last tile has no successor; only the bounded interior channel
    offsets between them are candidates.

    Under a node arm the first candidate index is ``1 + half_span`` rather than
    ``1``: index 0 is the lane HEAD, the one cell of the lane a router path can
    reach and therefore the cell every many-to-one merge lands on, and a seat at
    index ``half_span`` or less puts the 3x1 body over it.  That is the reported
    defect (``belt#0 (53,20,0) pred=[817, 1872]`` on coater#771's body).  At
    ``west_channel = 3`` this leaves exactly one candidate, ``ox - 1``; the
    staged-static clearance lift to 4 leaves two.

    **This is the path production seats coaters from** -- ``_place_coaters``
    calls this, not :func:`_coater_seat` (spec section 9 R7: a predicate added
    only to ``_coater_seat`` is dead code, since nothing in ``src/`` calls it).

    **Only ONE of ``prolif.coater_rides_one_run``'s two clauses is actually
    enforced here** (spec section 9 R9).  A candidate is skipped when it would
    have an ambiguous addon-area-1 supply
    (:func:`_coater_candidate_has_ambiguous_supply`, the validator's second
    clause) -- and that predicate is STRICTER than the validator, so it can
    only cost seats, never miss one.  :func:`_coater_candidate_rides_a_merge`,
    the first clause, is called but **filters nothing**: ``_place_coaters``
    runs BEFORE routing, and the merges that clause convicts are made by the
    ROUTER afterwards.  At seat time no candidate body tile carries a belt with
    two predecessors, so it returns ``False`` every time.  Filtering before
    routing can never catch a merge routing has not created yet; the validator
    stays the only thing that catches clause 1, and it catches it after a whole
    build has been spent.  The next lever is named in section 9 R9.

    ``_place_coaters`` treats an empty result exactly as it treats a lane with
    no legal seat at all: an :class:`_Unseatable` refusal, never a silently
    skipped coater.

    Index zero is excluded for a second reason as well: the game reads BOTH
    ends of the belt an addon rides and refuses the addon when either
    disagrees with its axis, so a seat needs a lane tile either side of it.
    See :func:`flab2bp.dsp.rules.addon_ride_is_straight`.

    **Why the seat is upstream of every sorter.**  A coater sprays what passes
    THROUGH it, so everything a machine takes has to reach the coater first.
    An input lane is emitted west to east and linked the same way --
    ``_emit_strip`` chains ``indices[k].output_obj = indices[k + 1]`` -- and
    the feeding net sinks into ``lane_idx[row][0]``, which is why ``_Port.x``
    is the lane's WEST end.  So an input lane flows west to east, its head is
    ``port.x``, and every sorter on it draws from a tile at or after the head.
    A seat after the first machine-facing tile would let that consumer take
    unsprayed cargo, which is why ``stop`` is ``west_channel``.

    **The measurement that made this rule.**  The seat used to be ``port.x1``,
    the lane's east end, on the reasoning that it is nearest the east margin
    the drop belt lived in.  That is the DOWNSTREAM end: the last belt of the
    chain, with no ``output_obj`` and nothing after it.  Measured over five
    clean proliferated freeform placements (``energy-matrix``, ``graphene``,
    ``plastic``, ``processor``, ``magnetic-coil``), **all 12 coaters were the
    last belt of their own chain and all 12 had zero pickups anywhere
    downstream of them** -- every sorter on every sprayed lane drew from a tile
    the cargo reached before the coater.  The spray was applied to cargo
    dead-ended at the end of a belt.  Spine on the same five specs seats 0 of
    12 at the tail.  So the blueprint pasted, the coaters were supplied,
    ``prolif.coaters_are_supplied`` passed -- and not one proliferated recipe
    would have run proliferated.  That is the failure this ordering prevents,
    and it is the reason the rule is not a matter of taste.

    **In production this returns ``False`` for every candidate, and therefore

    seat-selection time, and building one here was ruled out rather than

    A coater is a belt addon: it consumes no grid tile, so proliferation costs
    almost nothing in area.  The real cost is that it forces its edge onto a
    belt, which is what forbids direct insertion there.

    Two things this has to get right, both of which it previously did not:

    * **The coater must sit on the lane carrying the item it sprays.**  The old
      version took ``next(belt for belt in canvas.buildings ...)`` -- the first
      belt anywhere on the canvas -- so every coater piled onto one unrelated
      tile.
    * **It must be reachable from a proliferator supply.**  A coater with
      nothing feeding it sprays nothing, and the build then runs unproliferated
      while looking perfectly healthy.  Each coater gets a one-tile ``drop``
      belt one tile behind it, which a proliferator net is routed to.
    * **It must sit at the lane's HEAD, where the items arrive.**  See
      :func:`_coater_seats`, whose docstring carries the measurement that made
      that rule.
    * **Only ``REQUIRES_SPRAY`` lanes are coated.**  The destination-derived
      cargo domain is authoritative even for uniform sprayed demand; the
      item-level split set merely records coexistence.

    **A LANE THE SPEC WANTS SPRAYED EITHER GETS A COATER OR THIS RAISES.**  Each
    of the four ways a seat can fail used to be a ``continue``: no port for the
    item, a lane too short to offer a straight seat, no belt on the seat tile, a
    drop cell already taken -- and a fifth, an item no strip carries on a lane,
    which the loop never reaches at all.  Any one of them left the pack one
    coater short and nothing downstream could tell: ``game.addon_supply`` and
    ``prolif.coaters_are_supplied`` both iterate the coaters that EXIST.  Each
    raises :class:`_Unseatable` now, the sweep discards that height, and a spec
    where no height can seat them is refused.  The validator says the same thing
    about the finished placement from the other end --
    ``prolif.sprayed_cargo_reaches_machines`` -- so neither this nor a future
    strategy can put the miss back.
