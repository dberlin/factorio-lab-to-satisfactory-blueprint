"""Which slot a sorter names on the building it touches.

Every sorter we emitted before this module existed carried ``(0, 0, 0, 0)`` in
its four slot fields.  Pasted into the game that produced four errors and drew
**every** sorter red -- the first time anything we built was tried in game.  The
validator passed the same build with ``INVALID 0``, because nothing in it looked
at these fields at all.

THE THREE CONSTANTS
-------------------
``output_from_slot == 0`` and ``input_to_slot == 1`` on all 1288 sorters in
``tests/fixtures/*.txt``, without a single exception.  The BELT side of a
connection is always ``-1``.  Only the MACHINE side carries a real index.

Those three, the ``0.8`` reach and the ``24``-degree alignment are the GAME's
rules rather than this module's, and they are stated with their provenance in
:mod:`flab2bp.dsp.rules`.  This module imports them from there so that what we
EMIT and what ``layout.validate`` CHECKS can never drift apart.

THE MACHINE SIDE IS NOW READ FROM THE GAME, NOT INFERRED
--------------------------------------------------------
A slot index is a subscript into ``PrefabDesc.slotPoses``, and those poses are
shipped in the prefabs.  ``scripts/extract_dsp_slot_poses.py`` pulls them out;
:attr:`flab2bp.dsp.catalog.Building.slot_poses` serves them; :func:`machine_slot`
picks the one the game would pick -- the nearest pose whose forward agrees with
the direction the sorter arrives from.

This module used to guess instead, from a ring re-derived out of seven observed
buildings: twelve slots, three per side, handedness extrapolated by footprint
from a sample of two.  The real table says the ring is real but the
extrapolation was not:

* an **Assembling Machine** has 12, three per side, un-mirrored -- as derived;
* a **Matrix Lab** has 12, mirrored -- also as derived;
* an **Oil Refinery** has **9**, and not as a ring: 0-2 east, 3-5 west, 6-8 on
  the south face at ``z = -3.6``.  Its north face takes no sorter at all;
* a **Chemical Plant** has **8**, in two rows -- 0,1,2,7 along the north face
  at ``x in {-1, 0, 1, 2}``, and 3-6 along ``z = -0.9``, which is one row INSIDE
  a footprint five deep.  Four of the nine columns of a nine-wide building, and
  neither of the two long sides, will take a sorter anywhere.

The Chemical Plant is why a three-building blueprint containing one pasted with
"Sorter data error" while the same shape built from 3x3 Assembling Machines
pasted clean.  No ring rule could have produced that; only the table does.

WHAT "NEAREST" MEANS
--------------------
The game's own tolerance, :data:`flab2bp.dsp.rules.SLOT_REACH`.
``BuildTool_BlueprintCopy.CheckInserterDataLegal`` rejects a sorter whose end
lands more than that from the pose it names, and the paste path
(``BlueprintData``, ``EBuildCondition.ErrorInserterData``) snaps the end onto
the pose and rejects a comparable distance with a wider allowance for a purely
radial offset.  Both are ported in ``layout.validate``; this module uses the
same figure so that what we emit and what we check agree.

:func:`machine_slot` returns the nearest slot even when the nearest is further
than that, rather than raising.  A sorter whose end is nowhere near any slot is
a LAYOUT defect, and the validator names it as one -- refusing to encode it here
would only convert a reported error into a crash, and the nearest real slot is
the one the game would have snapped to.  It raises only when there is no slot to
name at all.

    """One sorter where the PASTE will put it, not where we wrote it.

    ``BlueprintUtils.RefreshBuildPreview`` (2090-2190 of the decompiled
    ``BlueprintUtils``) moves a sorter's end onto the slot pose it names before
    any build condition is evaluated::

        Pose pose = buildPreview2.input.desc.slotPoses[buildPreview2.inputFromSlot];
        Pose transformedBy = pose.GetTransformedBy(
            new Pose(buildPreview2.input.lpos, buildPreview2.input.lrot));
        buildPreview2.lpos = transformedBy.position;

    -- guarded by ``!buildPreview2.input.desc.isBelt``, and the same again for
    ``lpos2`` against ``outputToSlot``.  So the machine end of every sorter we
    emit is MOVED, typically by a tenth of a tile off the tile centre we chose,
    and the slot INDEX is what decides where it lands.  Any geometry question
    about a sorter -- reach, skew, collision -- has to be asked about the seated
    sorter or it is a question about a building the game will not create.

    ``None`` when the sorter has no second anchor, which
    ``sorter.anchors_present`` reports by name.

    THE OTHER END COMES WITH IT.  Seating a machine end does not stretch the
    sorter: three lines later the paste slides the BELT end sideways by the same
    delta, so the sorter stays straight (``RefreshBuildPreview`` 2100-2107, and
    the mirror image at 2151-2158)::

        if (buildPreview2.output != null && buildPreview2.output.desc.isBelt)
        {
            if (Mathf.Abs(Vector3.Dot((buildPreview2.lpos2 - buildPreview2.lpos)
                    .normalized, buildPreview2.output.lrot.Forward())) < 0.5f)
            {
                Vector3 vector6 = buildPreview2.lrot2.Forward();
                float num39 = Vector3.Dot(zero, vector6);
                buildPreview2.lpos2 += zero - vector6 * num39;
            }
        }

    ``zero`` is the seating delta of the end just moved, and what is added back
    is its component ACROSS the sorter's own axis, so the lateral part of the
    seat carries and the along-axis part does not.  It is not a small term: it
    is what puts the belt end 0.605 tiles off the tile we wrote for it on the
    blueprint this was built for.

    :data:`DRAG_MAX_ALIGNMENT` is the branch's own threshold, and the direction
    it is measured against is the belt's RECORDED yaw -- the pose the paste
    reads out of the blueprint, not the direction the belt turns out to run.
    The two differ on one of the 33 sorters the game built, and the recorded
    yaw is the one that predicts where it landed.

    HOW EXACT THIS IS, on the only sample that can say.  The user force-built a
    refused paste and blueprinted the result back out; the game built 33 of our
    38 sorters, and every one of those 66 ends is where this function says it
    is, to 2e-5 of a tile.  That comparison has to undo one thing first, and it
    is not a fitted correction: the copy was taken at 45 degrees of latitude,
    where a column is ``area_segments / 200 / cos(lat)`` of a tile rather than a
    tile, which is the same fixed-longitude-step effect ``geom.collide``
    documents.  ``area_segments`` is in the blueprint; the latitude is one
    unknown recovered from the 32 machine ends, and it lands inside the band the
    recorded ``area_segments`` requires.  A wrong seat model would not have
    admitted any latitude at all.

    A SLOT HOLDS ONE CONNECTION.  The game stores connections as

    whatever is already in the cell rather than refusing -- see
    :data:`~flab2bp.dsp.rules.CONN_SLOTS_PER_OBJECT`.  Every belt here used to
    leave ``output_to_slot`` at the dataclass default of ``0``, which is wrong
    twice: it is not a value the game ever writes for a belt-to-belt link, and
    where two belts merge into a third the two links landed in the same cell and
    one of them was dropped on paste.

    WHAT THE GAME WRITES, counted over the fixture corpus rather than guessed:

    * belt -> belt, ``output_to_slot``: **1** (7169 records), **2** (95),
      **3** (38).  Never 0, never above 3.  Those are the three INPUT slots of
      the receiving belt; slot 0 is where its own output link lives, so writing
      0 puts a predecessor's back-link in the cell the successor link needs.
    * belt <-> splitter: the one of ports **0..3** whose model/yaw-adjusted
      ``PrefabDesc.portPoses`` forward and height match the adjoining belt path.
    * and across all ~10,000 connection records in the corpus, **no
      ``(object, slot)`` cell is named twice.**

    The assignment mirrors the game's own scan -- ``WriteObjectConn`` resolving
    an unspecified peer slot walks upward from the first legal index and takes
    the first free one.  Belts are visited in index order so the result is
    deterministic.

    Raises :class:`SlotUndetermined` when a receiving belt is out of input slots.
    A fourth belt feeding one belt tile has nowhere to go: the game would drop
    the link silently, and a dropped link is a blueprint that pastes and then
    starves.

    A BELT DOCKED INTO A BUILDING PORT SPENDS ONE OF ITS OWN SLOTS, and that is
    why ``taken`` is seeded before the scan rather than filled only by it.  The
    connection is written on both ends -- ``entityConnPool[objId * 16 + slot]``
    is addressed once per object -- so a belt drawing from a port occupies its
    own slot :data:`~flab2bp.dsp.rules.BELT_PORT_DRAW_TO_SLOT`, which is 1, the
    first index this function would otherwise hand to a belt-to-belt feeder.
    Handing it out twice would evict the port link and leave a lane that pastes
    cleanly and carries nothing.  The corpus has no belt that both docks and
    takes a feeder, so it does not settle the case; it is settled the same way
    the pool is settled everywhere else, by not sharing a cell.
