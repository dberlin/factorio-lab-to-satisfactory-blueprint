"""Race the production portfolio for one wall budget.

Freeform, sequence-pair, transport-routing and hierarchical compete concurrently
in spawned children. Freeform and sequence-pair additionally exchange certified
bounds; every arm retains its own physical acceptance checks.

The process shape is deliberately the one ``sequence_islands.py`` already runs in
production: a frozen, ``slots=True`` request that is the whole pickled unit; a
frozen outcome that flattens ``NoValidLayout`` in the child rather than pickling
an exception; a spawn-context ``ProcessPoolExecutor`` with
``max_tasks_per_child=1``; one ``wait`` in the parent; and OS-level termination
for whatever is still running when the wall runs out.

This file carries the transport -- the request and outcome that cross the pickle
boundary, the two message kinds, and the channel that publishes and drains them
-- and the race itself: the child-side leg, the pool, and the parent's one
``wait``.  The receivers that consume a hint, and the merge rule that turns two
outcomes into one placement, land on top of it.

#: queue, and the parent unpickles it and resolves the future.  Spawn cost is
#: NOT part of this: the child is handed the parent's absolute deadline, so
#: starting up is search it loses, inside the wall rather than after it.
