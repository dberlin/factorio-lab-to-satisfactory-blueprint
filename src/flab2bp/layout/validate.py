"""The neutral judge.

Two layout strategies compete here, so every judgement about correctness lives
outside both of them.  Nothing in this module may depend on how a placement was
produced -- it sees only the frozen ``Placement`` contract and, when available,
the ``BuildSpec`` that placement was supposed to realise.

Checks return structured :class:`Finding` objects rather than booleans, because
a failure that cannot be debugged from the report alone is barely better than no
check at all.  Rates in ``detail`` are exact ``Fraction`` values rendered as
strings -- never floats, since rounding is precisely what these checks exist to
catch.

Two tiers of check
------------------
Geometry, sorter, belt and power checks need only a ``Placement``, so they run
against anything -- including real blueprints decoded from the game, which is
what makes a negative control possible.  Spec-conformance, proliferator and flow
checks additionally need a ``BuildSpec`` and an :class:`IdMap`; without those
they are reported in ``Report.skipped`` rather than silently passing.

    two lanes pointing at one tile leave three runs where the items see one

#:
#: ``game.belt_collide`` WAS here, on exactly that evidence and for exactly the

#: cross standing 2.30 units tall, so both strategies routed belts a tile from
#: one -- and one LEVEL above one, which is still inside it.  It came out the
#: same way ``geom.collide`` did: by giving the layouts the collider, not by
#: widening a bound.  ``colliders.belt_keepout_offsets`` measures the cells it
#: denies and ``junction.keepout_cells`` names them.
#:
#: Freeform stakes every belt before it takes a tap, so its site test is asked a
#: question that has an answer; ``_merge_frontier`` steers the router off a tap
#: whose keep-out already holds a foreign belt; and a junction guards its
#: collider's room against the passes that come after routing.  Spine lifted its

    """The declared footprint says where the building will actually be built.

    Not a game predicate.  It is the check that lets the game predicates mean
    anything, and it exists because of what ``PlacedBuilding.width``/``height``
    are.  Their own docstring calls them a footprint "cached here so geometry
    checks never need the catalog" -- a cache with no invalidation, filled in by
    hand by whichever strategy placed the building, and until now compared
    against nothing.

    Everything downstream reads the cache instead of the table.
    ``codec.tile_to_local_offset`` turns the min-corner anchor into DSP's
    ``localOffset`` as ``x + width / 2 - 0.5``, so the declared size decides the
    world position that gets EMITTED; ``geom.collide`` builds its
    ``colliders.Placed`` from that same offset, so a wrong size makes it test a
    real collider box at a pose that does not exist and hand back a confident
    pass.  A ported rule fed a wrong size is not a rule, it is a rubber stamp.

    TWO BRANCHES, because two conventions are in use and both are correct.

    A building that OCCUPIES TILES anchors on the minimum corner of its
    footprint, so its declared size must be
    ``catalog.oriented_footprint(item_id, yaw)`` -- the prefab's, with the
    quarter turn applied. Copying ``catalog.footprint`` and forgetting the turn
    is a live hazard rather than a hypothetical.

    A BELT ADDON anchors on the belt tile it RIDES, and must declare ``1x1`` so
    that ``tile_to_local_offset`` leaves its centre on that tile.  This is
    measured, not assumed: across ``factory-heretical-smelter-block`` and
    ``tillable-blackbox-module-...``, blueprints the game itself wrote, all
    eight Spray Coaters sit at their nearest belt's position to within
    ``(0.000, 0.000, 0.001)``.  A Spray Coater's prefab footprint is ``1x3`` and
    its collider is 3.5 world units long, and NEITHER of those is its anchor;
    ``occupies_tiles`` is false for it precisely because the tiles its collider
    covers are not tiles it reserves.  Asserting the prefab footprint here would
    convict a correct coater and, if anyone "fixed" the strategy to satisfy it,
    would move all twenty coaters a tile off their belts.  That was tried on
    this branch and reverted; the branch is here so it cannot be tried again by
    accident.

    HONEST NEGATIVE: this check convicts NOTHING in either strategy today.  A
    reported figure of 36 violations was all Spray Coaters and was the wrong
    reading above.  It is a guard on a cache, not a fix for a defect, and it is
    on by default because a check that fires on nothing costs nothing to run.

    forgive, and :func:`flab2bp.dsp.colliders.sorter_collisions` holds the C#

    Two things this check must do that a naive port would not, and both are

      machine end onto ``slotPoses[slot].GetTransformedBy(machine pose)`` before
      it tests anything (``BlueprintUtils.RefreshBuildPreview`` 2090-2190).  We
      emit tile centres; the game does not build them there.  Testing the tile
      centre would be testing a sorter the game will not paste.  A belt end is
      NOT seated -- the game's own guard is ``!desc.isBelt``.
    * **Stretch the box.**  A sorter's collider is not the prefab box at the
      record's position; it spans the two ends and grows past any end that meets
      a belt or nothing.

    WHY THIS IS AN ERROR AND NOT OPT-IN, which is the question ``game.belt_collide``
    answers the other way.  Over the 1132 sorters in the five single-area
    fixtures this reports ZERO pairs, and the sample is not vacuous -- the same
    corpus overlaps sorter bodies on a shared tile 97 times and carries 35
    belt-to-belt sorters, so a rule that convicted either shape would light it
    up.  Against that, the blueprint in ``tests/fixtures/sorter-collide-freeform.txt``

# not a rule: the game models an altitude-spanning sorter explicitly, and
# measures it.  `BuildTool_Inserter.cs:1311`::
#
#     float num4 = Mathf.Abs(lpos.magnitude - lpos2.magnitude) / 0.2f;
#
# -- the ends' difference in RADIUS, i.e. exactly the quantity the deleted check

# --- the game's own build conditions ---------------------------------------
#
# Everything under `game.` is a port of a predicate in the decompiled
# Assembly-CSharp, named in each docstring, rather than a rule inferred from the
# fixture corpus.  They exist because inference kept being wrong in ways only an
# in-game paste revealed: a slot ring extrapolated from seven buildings, a
# "three slots per side" rule the Chemical Plant's eight-slot two-row table
# disproves, and four separate hypotheses burned against the same paste error.
#
# Where the game works on the sphere and we work on a plane, the docstring says
# so.  Distances are float because the game's are -- these are Unity
# `Vector3.magnitude` comparisons against literal `0.8f`/`1.6f` thresholds, and
# rounding them to rationals would not make them more true.
#
# THREE CONDITIONS WERE READ AND DELIBERATELY NOT PORTED
#
# `NeedGround` (23, "Foundation required") is NOT a property of a blueprint and
# no check here can predict it.  In `BuildTool_BlueprintPaste` it is a terrain
# raycast: for every `landPoint` of the footprint the game casts 18 m down and
# refuses when the hit is below `-0.3 - landOffset` of the planet radius, or
# when the ground and the water layer differ by more than `0.27 + landOffset`,
# or when nothing is hit at all.  It means "the ground you are pasting onto is
# not flat, or is water" -- the same blueprint pastes fine one tile away.  It
# does not auto-foundation because reform is a separate, opt-in pass
# (`ComputeReform`), and it is answered by levelling the ground, not by us.
#
# `OutOfVerticalConstructionHeight` (40) on the paste path applies ONLY to
# stacked Tanks, Storages, Labs and Splitters: it compares the stack level
# implied by the building's altitude against `history.labLevel` /
# `history.storageLevel`, which are tech unlocks.  We never stack any of the
# four.  The belt-height ceiling that carries the same message comes from
# `BuildTool_Path` and `BuildTool_Click`, where it is `history.buildMaxHeight`
# -- also an unlock, so a blueprint legal for one save is not for another, and
# a fixed number here would be wrong for somebody.
#
# `Collide`, `TooClose` and `TooFar` for non-sorters need the near-collider
# index of a live planet (`GetOverlappedObjectsNonAlloc` against what is already
# built), which a blueprint does not carry.  `geom.overlap` covers the part that
# is intrinsic to the placement; the rest is a property of where it is pasted.

    ONE ``int`` per ``(object, slot)``.  Occupancy is keyed on the slot INDEX
    and not on the slot's pose, because the pose never enters the address --
    see :data:`~flab2bp.dsp.rules.CONN_SLOTS_PER_OBJECT`, where the C# is
    quoted.  A second connection written to an occupied slot does not fail: it
    calls ``ClearObjectConn`` on the sitting tenant first and evicts it.

    Every directed record occupies one cell on BOTH endpoints:

    * ``output_obj`` uses this object's ``output_from_slot`` and the peer's
      ``output_to_slot``;
    * ``input_obj`` uses this object's ``input_to_slot`` and the peer's
      ``input_from_slot``.

    Counting only the peer fields misses a dock or Splitter draw spending the
    receiving belt's own slot 1 while an upstream feeder names that same belt
    and slot.  Conversely, the two fields of one self-link may name the same
    cell; that is one connection and is counted once, not mistaken for two
    different records.

    Ends recorded as :data:`~flab2bp.dsp.rules.BELT_SLOT` are exempt.
    ``-1`` means "the game picks", and ``WriteObjectConn`` then takes the first
    free cell in :data:`~flab2bp.dsp.rules.BELT_SLOT_AUTO_RANGE`, so such an end
    names no fixed cell to share.

    It runs on the anchors and yaws the BLUEPRINT carries, NOT on the snapped
    ones ``game.inserter_paste`` works with.  That was measured, after a first
    version assumed the opposite and the corpus threw it out: of 923 real
    sorters, the snapped reading rejects 11 -- every one an Oil Refinery in
    ``factory-quick-start-step-3-red-cube``, a blueprint the game ships -- on
    both the length test and the 24-degree one, and adding the belt-end lateral
    shift the paste path also applies fixes the angle and leaves the length.
    Read raw, all 923 pass with room: the tightest length clears its minimum by
    0.511 tiles and the worst end sits 9.9 degrees off its axis against a limit
    of 24.

    That has a consequence worth stating plainly, because an earlier commit
    message here claimed the opposite: **a backwards sorter yaw is NOT rejected
    by this**.  Read raw, ``lrot`` and ``lrot2`` are both the blueprint's own
    yaw, so their angle is zero however the sorter is turned, and the axis test
    takes an absolute value, so a reversal reads as zero too.  The yaw is still
    derived from the geometry in ``assign_sorter_slots`` -- 1250 of 1250 real
    sorters point from the end they draw from to the end they feed, and we were
    writing 69 of 125 backwards -- but that rests on the corpus being unanimous,
    not on any ported predicate refusing it.

    Port of the ``AddonPass`` excusal in ``BuildTool_BlueprintPaste``, which is
    what keeps a belt running under a Spray Coater from being called a
    collision.  For each of the addon's areas::

        Vector3 vector  = addon.lpos + addon.lrot * (colPose.position
                                                     + colPose.forward * size.z * 3f);

        float num2 = Maths.DistancePointLine(belt.lpos, vector, vector2);
        float num3 = 1f;
        if (flag) num3 = Mathf.Abs(Vector3.Dot((vector2 - vector).normalized, rhs));
        flag3 |= num2 < 0.3f;
        flag3 &= num3 > 0.95f;          # <- the direction test
        flag2 |= flag3;

    ``rhs`` is the belt's own direction of travel, taken from its preview links
    and not from any stored yaw::

        if (input == null && output != null) rhs = (output.lpos - lpos).normalized;
        if (input != null && output == null) rhs = (lpos - input.lpos).normalized;

    and the line it is dotted against runs along the addon's area, which the
    addon's ``lrot`` -- its YAW -- aims.  When ``AddonPass`` returns false the
    belt is not excused, ``flag6`` is set and the belt becomes
    ``EBuildCondition.Collide``; the later re-probe at 147451 does not rescue
    it, because that clause refuses to excuse a belt that is CLOSE to an addon
    area, which the ridden belt is by definition.

    ``Mathf.Abs`` is why this convicts a right angle and not a reversal.  A
    coater yawed 180 from its belt dots to -1, passes, and pastes.  A coater
    yawed 90 dots to 0 and turns the belt under it red -- "Collide with other
    object".

    WHY ``game.addon_supply`` CANNOT CATCH THIS, which is the part worth
    keeping.  That check computes the addon area's cell FROM the addon's own yaw
    and then asks whether a belt is there -- and the strategy that chose the yaw
    put the belt at that same computed cell.  It validates our choice against
    itself, so a wrong yaw is invisible to it by construction.  This check is
    anchored to something we did not choose: the direction of flow through the
    ridden belt, read from the ``output_obj`` LINK GRAPH.

    MEASURED.  The game's own eight Spray Coaters -- five in
    ``factory-heretical-smelter-block``, three in
    ``tillable-blackbox-module-...`` -- carry the flow yaw EXACTLY, 8 of 8, over
    two different run directions.  ``spine`` matches them, 16 of 16.
    ``freeform`` does not: of the twenty coaters on the reported blueprint's
    ``max-proliferation`` candidate, ten disagree -- six standing across a belt
    that flows north and four reversed on a belt that flows west -- because it
    writes one yaw for every coater regardless of the lane it lands on.  Only
    the six are convicted here; the four reversals are recorded in the finding
    count of neither, because the game accepts them and a check that refused
    them would be ours rather than the game's.

    WHAT THIS CHECK CANNOT SEE, and ``game.addon_corner`` below can.  Reading
    the successor "or its predecessor when it has none" reads exactly ONE end of
    the ridden belt.  A belt that arrives from the north and leaves to the east
    agrees with a coater yawed 90 at the end this reads, so this check passes
    it.  Six of ``freeform``'s twenty coaters on a later blueprint the user
    pasted were in that state and this check reported nothing about any of them
    -- measured, 0 findings here against 6 there on the same file.

    that check looks at, and disagrees at the end it does not.  This is the
    other end.

    The rule, at decompiled 145812 -- the addon half of the paste ladder, where
    a pasted addon meets a belt that is already on the planet or already a
    prebuild::

        float num23 = Maths.DistancePointLine(objectPose2.position, lineStart2, lineEnd2);

    and when the excusal is not taken the addon falls through to
    ``buildPreview2.condition = EBuildCondition.Collide``.  Both the belt's own
    INPUT belt and its OUTPUT belt must lie on the addon's line, not just the
    belt itself.  A corner puts one of them a tile off it.

    The hand tool states the same rule as an ANGLE rather than a distance, over
    the same two neighbours (``BuildTool_Addon.CheckBuildConditions``), and that
    is the form :func:`flab2bp.dsp.rules.addon_ride_is_straight` ports, because
    our grid is cardinal and an angle carries the altitude clause with it.
    Placing a Spray Coater by hand on a belt that turns under it is refused.

    SCOPE, stated plainly because it bounds what a finding here proves.  The
    paste path has THREE addon-versus-belt clauses and only two carry this
    rule:

    * 145812, quoted above -- addon preview against an EXISTING belt or
      prebuild.  Corner refused.
    * ``BuildTool_Addon`` -- hand placement.  Corner refused.
    * ``AddonPass`` (BuildTool_BlueprintPaste, and its twin at 147454) -- an
      addon and a belt from the SAME paste.  **No corner clause at all**, and
      its one direction test is dead for a mid-run belt: ``flag`` is set only
      when exactly one of ``input``/``output`` is null, so a belt with both
      leaves ``num3`` at ``1f``.

    So a finding here is NOT proof that a first paste onto bare ground is
    rejected.  It is proof that the geometry is one the game refuses in the two
    places it looks at both ends -- including a re-paste over the prebuilds the
    first paste left.

    MEASURED, and it is why the assumption this closes was wrong.  The game's
    own eight Spray Coaters -- five in ``factory-heretical-smelter-block``,
    three in ``tillable-blackbox-module-...`` -- ride a straight belt 8 of 8,
    zero corners.  ``freeform``'s twenty coaters on the reported
    ``max-proliferation`` blueprint were 14 straight and **6 turning**, every
    one of them entering from ``(0, 1)`` and leaving to ``(1, 0)`` under a yaw
    of 90.  ``game.addon_facing`` passed all six: it read the outgoing step,
    which agrees with the yaw, and nothing looked at where the cargo came from.

    machine.  So the answer to "may a belt cross a building" is YES, and the
    price is height: the probe reaches ``0.23 - 0.2 = 0.03`` below the belt
    node, so a belt clears a collider whose top stands ``t`` above the ground

    0.76 over a Sorter.  :func:`flab2bp.dsp.colliders.belt_crossing_height`
    computes it per model.

    A Splitter is NOT a belt for this purpose.  ``PrefabDesc.ReadPrefab`` line
    217564 sets ``isBelt = beltSpeed > 0`` from a ``BeltDesc``; a splitter takes
    the ``SplitterDesc`` branch and sets ``isSplitter``.  An elevated splitter
    over a machine is an ordinary box-against-box question, and ``geom.collide``
    is where it is asked.

    THE LATERAL HALF IS NOT ASKED HERE.  It exists now -- the excusal that made
    it tractable was found, and ``game.belt_collide`` below is the same rule
    without this narrowing -- but that check is in :data:`OPT_IN` and this one is
    not, so this one keeps the narrowing it always had: only belts whose probe
    centre stands INSIDE a collider's footprint, and only above it.

    What HAS changed is that the excusals now apply here too, which can only
    make this weaker and more correct: a belt over the building its own run
    reaches is no longer convicted for reaching it.

    Scope, and where it is still a LOWER bound.

    * Sorters and belt addons are left out entirely because the game excuses
      them (145871 and ``AddonPass`` at 145885/147454); belt on belt is
      ``geom.belt_single_occupancy``'s question, not this one.
    * ``catalog.UNPLACED_LOW_CONFIDENCE_FOOTPRINTS`` is left out -- the distrusted
      footprints we never place.  One we DO place is convicted here like any other
      building: the exemption's own justification is "none of them placed by the
      generator", and the mode-driven Energy Exchanger falsified it.
      ``game.belt_collide`` consults the SAME narrowed set, so the sentence above
      about it being "the same rule without this narrowing" still holds -- the two
      differ only in the probe-inside restriction, never in the exemption.
    * ``multiLevel`` buildings are left out HERE, because a belt one level above
      a Splitter or Storage Tank is on its raised port rather than crossing it
      and this check cannot tell the two apart.  ``game.belt_collide`` can: the
      connection is what excuses it there, so it needs no such guess.

    Negative control: zero findings on ``catalog.GEOMETRY_SAFE_FIXTURES`` and on
    the derived ``test_local_offset.GEOMETRY_CORPUS``.  Not vacuous -- 133 belts
    in the single-area fixtures pass over or under a collider and clear it, and

    """A belt passing OVER a belt addon owes it the same clearance as anything else.

    This half is separate because the addon is excused twice over on the way
    here, and both excusals are right about the case they were written for and
    wrong about this one.

    * ``colliders.belt_collisions`` never reports a belt against a belt addon at
      all, on the ``AddonPass`` reading -- and ``AddonPass`` is about a belt the
      addon is ATTACHED to.  The belt it rides and the belt on its proliferator
      area are what that clause exists to excuse.
    * ``_stacks`` takes a Spray Coater out of the crossing question because
      ``PrefabDesc.multiLevel`` is set for it, and for a Splitter or a Storage
      Tank a belt one level up really is on a raised port.  A coater's raised
      port is not overhead: area 1 sits at ``(0, -1.25, 1)``, a tile and a
      quarter BEHIND it.  Directly over the coater there is no port, only 1.8975
      of collider.

    CONFIRMED IN GAME, by paste, which is why this is here rather than in the
    backlog.  The failing blueprint was cut down to one coater, its tower and
    every belt within six tiles -- no machines, no sorters -- and the game
    flagged the BELT directly over the coater.  Our proliferator chain crosses
    at ``z = 1`` and ``colliders.belt_crossing_height`` for the coater's model is
    ``1.8975``, so it owes ``z = 2``.

    MEASURED.  Over the eight coaters in the game's own blueprints there is not
    one belt above a coater and under its clearance: the belts inside a coater's
    footprint are either on the addon's own area cells or on the SAME level
    beside it, which the ``z`` test lets through.  Our own output has six such
    belts in ``freeform`` and eight in ``spine`` -- six at one level, two at one
    and a half.

    The two excusals kept: a belt at or below the addon's own level (it rides
    one, and the game's blueprints are full of belts flanking a coater at
    ground level), and a belt standing on one of the addon's area cells, which
    is a connection and is what ``game.addon_supply`` requires to be there.

    ``output_obj``, so before this a docked belt was wired by nothing and
    verified by nothing.

    WHAT THE GAME WRITES, counted over the fixture corpus.  178 belt-to-port
    records across five of the ten real blueprints -- 20 Energy Exchangers in
    ``temple-of-effectiveness``, one in ``falk-v7-mall-full``, and the
    Interstellar Logistic Stations of four more -- unanimous on all four of:

    * the BUILDING records nothing.  ``output_obj = input_obj = -1`` on all 28
      hosts.  The belt does the naming, as it does for a splitter;
    * the index is a subscript into ``PrefabDesc.portPoses``, our
      :attr:`catalog.Building.port_poses`, NOT into the sorter array;
    * a belt drawing carries ``input_to_slot`` = 1 and a belt feeding carries
      ``output_from_slot`` = 0 -- :data:`~flab2bp.dsp.rules.BELT_PORT_DRAW_TO_SLOT`
      and ``BELT_PORT_FEED_FROM_SLOT``;
    * the belt stands on the port, within
      :data:`~flab2bp.dsp.rules.BELT_PORT_MAX_TILE_GAP`.

    THE BELT'S OWN SLOT IS A POOL CELL LIKE ANY OTHER.  The game addresses a
    connection as ``entityConnPool[objId * 16 + slot]`` and writes it on BOTH
    ends, so a belt drawing from a port has spent its own slot 1 -- the first
    index ``slots.assign_belt_slots`` hands to a belt-to-belt feeder.  Two
    connections in that cell means ``WriteObjectConn`` evicts one, and the lane
    pastes cleanly and carries nothing.  ``game.slot_occupancy`` detects that
    pool collision globally; the last clause below retains the port-specific
    finding that names which dock already spends the slot.

    A belt naming a building with NO port is the same defect one step earlier.
    Nothing in the game will attach it -- ``BuildTool_Path`` drops a cast target
    whose ``portPoses`` is empty -- so the record describes a connection that
    cannot exist, and the item it carries stops there.

    The junction clause is the one that needed adding.  A run whose tail feeds a

    without ever asking whether anything draws from the far side.  A junction
    with no taps is a hole items fall into: the run terminates, the link
    resolves, and the flow stops.  That is graded an ERROR while dead lane stays
    a WARNING, because wasted belt costs area and a dead junction means the items
    routed into it never arrive.

    The warning half used to ask only whether the TAIL TILE was tapped, which is
    not the same question as whether the lane wastes anything.  Both strategies
    end a lane a couple of tiles past its last consumer, so a correct lane failed
    a tail-tile test while wasting two tiles out of fifty, and the check reported
    on 73% of belt runs across both strategies' fixtures -- a warning nobody
    reads.  What is worth acting on is the SIZE of the overshoot, so that is what
    is measured and reported, judged against :data:`_TERMINATION_SLACK`.

    lower than the 73% above because lane trimming landed in between; the rule
    change and the trimming are separate wins and this is the rule change's
    half.)  The survivors carry their own justification: a median of 8 dead tiles
    and a tail of 44, with four lanes across the corpus that no sorter touches
    anywhere.  Each finding names the number of tiles to cut.

    is not a collision and ``geom.collide`` cannot stand in for it: a Tesla
    Tower has NO build collider -- ``colliders.build_colliders(2201)`` is empty
    -- so two of them may sit on the same tile without any box intersecting.

    WHY THIS IS AN ERROR AND NOT OPT-IN.  It was found by shipping: the user
    pasted ``tests/fixtures/ours/power-too-close-freeform.txt`` into the game
    and every sorter, belt and machine built, while two of its six Tesla Towers
    were refused at 1.777 world units apart.  The other four sit 11.24 units
    and further from everything and built.  So the bound is bracketed by
    observation as well as by citation, and the citation puts it at 3.5.

    The control is the corpus.  Over the seven single-area blueprints in
    ``tests/fixtures`` -- 75 power nodes and 1468 pairs, in blueprints the GAME
    wrote -- this convicts **zero**, and the sample is not vacuous in kind: it
    carries 54 Tesla Towers in one blueprint and pairs as close as 6.00 tiles
    against a bound of 2.785.  Multi-area fixtures are excluded for the reason
    ``tests/dsp/test_colliders.py`` excludes them from every geometric test: a
    building's local offset is relative to its own area, and the flat frame puts
    two areas' buildings tens of tiles from where they belong.

    ORDERED pairs, not unordered, because the rule is not symmetric -- twice
    over.  The guard at ``:2527`` exempts an ACCUMULATOR being placed while the
    loop it guards asks only ``isPowerNode`` of the building it looks at, so an
    Accumulator may stand on top of another Accumulator and a Tesla Tower may
    not stand on top of either.  And the loop scans only protos in
    :data:`~flab2bp.dsp.rules.PASTE_POWER_NODE_IDS`, which the Signal Tower is a
    power node OUTSIDE of.  Both asymmetries land on the same case: the game

    ``prolif.coaters_are_supplied`` asks whether a belt CARRYING proliferator
    sits in area 1.  It cannot ask whether anything ever puts proliferator on
    that belt, because ``carries_item`` is a label the emitter writes, not a
    flow.  A Spray Coater node's proliferator port is two belts of the node's
    own making -- the supply belt on ``slots.addon_supply_cell(..., area=1)``
    and the approach belt one tile further out -- and the run they form is
    joined to the external proliferator entry by
    ``freeform._proliferator_supply_tree``.  If that join is missing, the node
    is a coater with a two-belt stub beside it: it pastes, the machines run,
    the recipe runs unproliferated, and every other check passes.

    Sourcedness is asked the same way ``flow.lane_sourced`` asks it, over the
    same run graph and the same junction closure, so the two cannot disagree
    about what "fed" means.

    ONE NARROWING, and without it this check has no content.  ``flow.lane_sourced``
    exempts any run carrying an external input, on the ground that the player
    fills it from outside.  Proliferator IS an external input, and both port
    belts are labelled with it, so a severed stub inherits that exemption and
    reads as fed -- MEASURED on a ``proliferated_spec`` build: severing the
    entry's link to the approach belt left the port on its own two-tile run,
    still ``_external_item``-exempt, and the whole placement still validated
    with zero errors.  So the exemption is asked of the run's tiles OTHER than
    the node's own port belts.  On the same build unsevered, the port shares a
    seven-tile run with the entry belt at ``(0, 9, 0)``, which carries
    ``proliferator-3`` and is not a port belt, so the exemption is earned and
    the coater is clean.  Nothing else about sourcedness changes: internal
    seeds, run-to-run feeding and the junction closure are ``flow.lane_sourced``'s
    verbatim.

    The narrowing is exactly the difference between "labelled proliferator" and
    "reachable from a proliferator source", which is the difference this check
    exists to state.  A run that is only two belts a coater put beside itself is
    not somewhere the player can belt into: it is one tile from the coater body,
    inside the block, and the tool -- not the player -- chose the cell.

    Forward reachability over the belt graph from every point unsprayed cargo
    can enter it, stopped at each coater.  Spray rides on the items and does not
    survive crafting, so the question a proliferated machine asks is not "is
    there a coater on my lane" but "did what I am eating go through one" -- and
    those differ by exactly the defects this exists to catch: a coater seated
    downstream of a sorter, and a lane that got no coater at all.

    THREE WAYS UNSPRAYED CARGO GETS ONTO A BELT, and missing any one of them
    would make this lenient in a way a strategy could sit inside:

    * a run head with no belt or junction feeding it -- cargo from outside the
      block, which is every external ingredient;
    * a sorter putting onto a belt from a MACHINE -- an internally produced
      ingredient, which ``prolif.belt_required_edges_not_direct_inserted`` has
      just forced onto a belt precisely so it can be sprayed;
    * a run head fed only by junctions or runs that are themselves unsprayed.

    A SORTER FROM BELT TO BELT IS AN EDGE, NOT A SOURCE -- a lane-to-lane
    transfer, which is how a trunk is tapped onto a branch without spending a
    splitter.  It carries whatever it draws, sprayed or not, so it has to be
    FOLLOWED: transport adjacency excludes sorter transfers, so it would leave
    every branch fed only by a transfer reading as clean whatever its trunk
    carries. ``_build_graph`` already links the two runs, so the branch's head
    is not mistaken for a source; the tile-level edge is supplied here by
    ``sorter_hops``.

    Cargo AT the coater's own tile counts as sprayed.  The coater is an addon on
    that belt and the items pass through it there, which is why both strategies
    aim to seat one at the first tile of a lane rather than the tile before it.

    Restricted to belts that can plausibly carry ``item``: a run whose
    ``carries_item`` labels name other items and not this one cannot put this
    item into anything, and treating it as a source of unsprayed cargo would
    convict a lane for what a neighbouring lane carries.  An UNLABELLED run
    counts, because "we do not know" is not "nothing here".

    """A proliferated machine must eat cargo that went THROUGH a coater.

    ``spec.spray_lanes`` names the ingredients whose lanes carry a Spray Coater,
    and until now nothing checked that any of them did.  Both strategies could
    skip a coater silently -- ``freeform._place_coaters`` ``continue``d when the
    drop cell was taken or the lane was too short to offer a legal seat, and
    ``spine`` seated one and then let the sorters draw from upstream of it.  The
    blueprint pastes either way, the machines run either way, and the build
    simply misses its rate: the same silent class as a coater at the tail of its
    own lane and as two sorters on one machine slot, both of which shipped.

    So the question is asked from the MACHINE's end, which is where correctness
    lives.  A proliferated group must draw each sprayed ingredient downstream
    of a coater -- that half stays ``Severity.ERROR``: it is a silent rate
    miss, the entire reason this check exists.  For an item in
    ``lanes_requiring_split``, an unproliferated group drawing downstream of a
    coater over-produces that item's proliferator cost -- under the user's
    ruling (2026-09-07, "over-proliferating is fine if it makes life
    easier") that half is only ``Severity.WARNING``: the build still pastes,
    still runs, and still hits its rate, so refusing the placement over it
    would refuse an otherwise legal build.  The finding still names the item
    and still fires, because the build should still be told.

    ``lanes_requiring_split`` itself is UNCHANGED by that ruling and stays
    mandatory where two consumers of one item want *different* proliferator
    modes: a Spray Coater holds one proliferator item and
    ``RateSolution.tier`` is global to the solve, so one physical lane cannot
    carry two proliferator tiers at once.  That split is a geometry
    requirement, not a cost opinion, and the WARNING above never applies to
    it -- it applies only to a shared-tier lane an unproliferated consumer
    happens to also draw from.

    ``prolif.coaters_are_supplied`` cannot answer this and never could.  It asks
    whether proliferator reaches the coater; it says nothing about whether the
    coater reaches the machines, and on a placement with no coater at all it
    yields nothing, because it iterates the coaters that exist.

    MEASURED at the time it landed, over the first six corpus URLs and every
    proliferated candidate they offer: ``freeform`` 0 of 61 sprayed pickups
    unsprayed, ``spine`` 15 of 61 -- every one of the fifteen a coater seated
