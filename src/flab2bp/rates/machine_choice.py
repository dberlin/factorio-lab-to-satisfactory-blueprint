"""Choosing a machine when the URL's rank is a ceiling rather than a mandate.

FactorioLab's machine rank is a mandate: ``select_machine`` takes the first
ranked producer and builds every machine of that recipe out of it, even when
the rate needs a fraction of one.  ``MachineRank.UP_TO`` reads the same rank
as a ceiling and takes the slowest producer that still meets the already-fixed
rate in the same number of machines.

The arithmetic is exact and the ceiling is the rank's own machine, so the
choice can never need MORE machines than ``exact`` does: ``ceil(r / s)`` is
non-increasing in ``s`` and the ceiling has the greatest speed on its own
ladder.  Only the building placed changes, and only ever downward.
