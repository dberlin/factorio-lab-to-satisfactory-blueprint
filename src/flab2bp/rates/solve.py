"""The production solve: FactorioLab's objective and exact flows out.

Each candidate fixes one proliferator mode per recipe before solving. That
removes mode-activation binaries and leaves a small fixed-charge MILP over craft
rates and integer physical machine counts. The URL's recipe, machine, footprint,
and surplus costs are applied with FactorioLab's exact coefficient semantics,
including every enabled extraction recipe as an ordinary priced column
competing with crafting rather than a structural cut.

Every rate leaving the solver is recovered by an exact Rational LP inside the
bought capacities. Machines may idle, so upstream demand follows exact craft
rates rather than spare capacity, and no float reaches ``BuildSpec``.

``prove_minimal=False`` is the explicit continuous alternative: optimise the
same FactorioLab costs, recover exact rates over the selected support, then take
the exact machine ceiling. It preserves every material support column and
expands exact recovery if a discarded tiny flow is required for balance.

Both solvers come from ortools. Do not reintroduce ``highspy``: it and ortools
cannot safely share a process because ortools bundles its own incompatible
HiGHS library, while the layout stage also requires ortools' CP-SAT backend.

    Returns the producing recipes for each internal item, plus the set of items
    that may be belted in.  An item is belted in when the URL supplies it (an
    Input objective) or when nothing here can make it.  A declared supply with
    a rate does NOT stop the walk: the item is external AND internal at once,
    belted in up to the declared rate and crafted for whatever demand is left
    over (``_lp_demand``).  Otherwise the item stays
    internal, with its crafting recipes and (unless it is a requested output)
    its enabled extraction recipes (``_extraction_producers``) BOTH offered as
    producers: the production LP prices every one of them and picks whichever
    mix is globally cheapest, exactly as FactorioLab's ``adjustCosts`` does. A
    requested output never gets an extraction option -- an Output objective
    asks for the item to be MADE, and a blueprint of zero machines satisfies
    nobody -- so it is always crafted.  Known over-reach: that removes the
    extraction option for the item's INTERNAL demand too, so an Output
    objective on an item the chain also consumes (sulfuric acid alongside
    graphene) crafts the consumed share as well, where FactorioLab would
    extract it; forcing only the objective quantity to be crafted needs an
    extra LP row and is not done yet. Extraction recipes
    contribute no further edges to the walk: they have no inputs.

    With a positive surplus cost, FactorioLab traverses recipes that either
    produce or consume each visited item and follows both their inputs and
    outputs. That wider closure lets downstream recipes consume coproduct
    surplus.

    its bought capacities.

    support cannot be recovered, the fixed-charge model is the fallback.

    speed changes craft time, not the per-craft input and output vectors.
