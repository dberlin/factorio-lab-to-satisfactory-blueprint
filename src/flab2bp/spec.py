"""The frozen boundary between rate reasoning and geometry.

Everything upstream of this module is arithmetic on rationals with no notion of
space.  Everything downstream is geometry with no notion of rates.  ``BuildSpec``
is the only thing that crosses.

These are pydantic models rather than dataclasses, deliberately and only here.
A ``BuildSpec`` is built three or four times per run, so validation is free; the
geometry types it feeds are built ~9,000 times per layout call and stay as
``slots=True`` dataclasses for that reason.  What pydantic buys is enforcement of
the invariants this docstring used to merely assert -- notably that no machine
demands an item nothing supplies, which was documented and unchecked.

``Fraction`` is supported natively and exactly (``"16.5"`` parses to ``33/2``,
not a float), so the exactness guarantee survives the boundary.
