"""Submit-and-poll, because a build is seconds to minutes.

``--budget`` is per layout and ``best`` lays out every candidate with every
active production strategy. Unpinned web requests run those independent
candidate races concurrently under one bounded CPU allowance; their aggregate
solver work is still ``candidates × strategies × budget``. A synchronous
request would still look like a hang to browsers and proxies, and a connection
dying would take the result with it.
So a build is a job -- submitted, then polled.

One submitted job runs at a time by default, deliberately. Inside that job the
pipeline caps its default aggregate solver budget at 16 CPUs from the process
affinity set, divides that budget across a bounded candidate pool, and each
candidate divides its share between the two strategy racers. Running separate
jobs concurrently would oversubscribe that allowance, so the outer queue
remains the honest answer: a job that waits says so, with its position.
