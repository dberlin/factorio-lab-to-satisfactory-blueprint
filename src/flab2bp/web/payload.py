"""A :class:`~flab2bp.pipeline.Build` as JSON.

This is the web twin of ``cli._report``, and it exists for the same reason that
function does: the blueprint string is the smallest interesting thing a build
produces.  What was refused and why, whether the recipe selection was pinned or
re-derived, and whether the belt ceiling was read or assumed are the parts a
player has to know before trusting the result, and all three read as silence if
nobody serialises them.

Two rules the CLI already follows and this must not break:

* **A refusal is a result.**  ``NoValidLayout`` says which strategy/candidate
  pairs produced nothing and why, and that reason is the useful output -- so it
  is serialised into a shape the UI can render as an answer, not as a crash.
* **An invalid blueprint is worse than no blueprint.**  ``pipeline.build`` will
  return its least-bad attempt when nothing validated, so the string is withheld
  unless the caller explicitly asked for it, exactly as ``--allow-invalid`` does.
