"""The HTTP surface: four endpoints and a static directory.

On the standard library, on purpose.  A build is CPU-bound for seconds to
minutes behind a queue that is one worker deep, so nothing here is under any
throughput pressure that would justify making ``flab2bp`` -- a CLI -- depend on
a web framework.  ``ThreadingHTTPServer`` answers polls while a solve holds a
worker thread, which is the entire concurrency requirement.

    POST /api/build          submit; returns an id
    GET  /api/build/<id>     poll; returns state, and the result when there is one
    GET  /api/health         is the server up, and is the front end built
    GET  /api/fetch?url=...  the viewer's own blueprint-page proxy
    GET  /*                  the built front end, with an SPA fallback

Bound to 127.0.0.1 by default.  ``/api/fetch`` is a relay to any http(s) URL
whose host resolves to a public address -- every redirect hop is checked, but
the address is resolved and connected to separately, so a name that changes
between the two still gets through -- and ``/api/build`` will spend up to 16
available CPUs on a solver portfolio for anyone who asks. Neither belongs on a
public interface without work this does not do.

        Kept because the viewer's "or URL" field is a feature we took over, and
        dropping it while serving the same page from Python would have been a
        silent regression in an inherited app.  Same shape as the original: the
        page body as plain text, 400 on bad input, 502 carrying the real reason
        when the upstream is unreachable.

        Unlike the original, every hop is checked.  The viewer followed
        redirects blind, so an allowed public URL could hand back a `302` to
        `http://127.0.0.1:.../api/build` and the proxy would dutifully fetch it
        -- the whole point of a redirect-based SSRF.  Redirects are followed by
        hand instead, and each target is resolved and rejected if it lands on a
        loopback, private, link-local or otherwise reserved address.

        This is not a complete SSRF defence and is not offered as one: the
        address is resolved here and connected to by httpx a moment later, so a
        DNS entry that changes between the two still gets through.  Closing
        that needs a transport that pins the socket to the address it checked,
        which is a different piece of work.  What this closes is the redirect
        hop, which needed no race at all.
