be able to fail for layout reasons alone, and a dependency on the rate solver

    """Shaped like the super-magnetic-ring chain, and RATE-BALANCED.

    Nine groups, 54 machines, every machine running at 1/s.  The counts are the
    unique solution of the chain's stoichiometry at two rings per second, so
    supply equals demand for every internal item and every external input equals
    what its consumers draw::

        ring 2      <- turbine 4, graphite 2, magnet 6
        turbine 4   <- motor 4, coil 4
        motor 4     <- ingot 4, gear 4, coil 4
        coil 8      <- magnet 8, copper 8
        gear 4      <- ingot 4
        ingot 8     <- iron-ore 8       magnet 14 <- iron-ore 14
        copper 8    <- copper-ore 8     graphite 2 <- coal 2

    It used to be round numbers instead -- 4 magnetic-coil/s against 12/s of
    demand, and 17 magnet/s on a 12/s belt.  Any test asserting flow-clean on it
    therefore failed for reasons with nothing to do with geometry, which is worse
    than no test: it makes the flow checks unusable on the one fixture with
    enough shape to exercise them.

    The belt is Mk.III because the busiest lane -- iron-ore at 22/s, feeding both
    the ingot and the magnet rows -- does not fit on Mk.II.  Under-sizing the
    belt would reintroduce exactly the failure this fixture exists to avoid.

    These numbers are deliberately identical to ``test_spine``'s fixture of the
    same name.  The two strategies are compared on this shape, and a comparison
    across two different specs is not one.

        lanes and was two.  Spec §9 R1 bans that build, so six refuses again --

        above and only two below, and six single-item lanes need six rows.

    ``group_key``s keep the symmetry-breaking cut in ``_pack`` from adding its

    Strip 0 alone is as tall as the pack (height 6), so it owns a column by

    stacks them into the other column -- any wider arrangement costs more area
    and loses.  A net from strip 0 to strip 2 then breaks the tie between
    stacking orders in favour of the one with the smaller half-perimeter, which
    is strip 2 directly beside strip 0.  That gives one predictable minimum-width
    packing -- strip 0 at the origin, strip 2 offset by exactly its own width --
    for the no-good tests to forbid and then prove absent.

    """A belt branch must carry the items of the net that built it.

    ``_source_for`` took the first adjacent belt carrying the right item, and at
    a merge point several do.  The router only ever starts a path away from its
    own lane on a ``_merge_frontier`` cell of a net that SHARES THAT LANE
    (``_route_all``'s ``src_group``), so any other belt beside the head belongs
    to a different producer -- branching off it silently swaps one source for
    another.

    That is the whole of the intermittent ``flow.conservation`` on
    ``quantum-chip/free-proliferation``.  ``titanium-glass`` shards into a
    four-machine and a three-machine strip, ``plane-filter`` into lanes of
    6/5/5, and the cyclic pairing hands the four-machine shard eleven consumers.
    ``_connect_short_cuts`` prices that island, finds it starving, and buys ONE
    extra net -- three-machine shard to the six-machine lane -- which is the only
    thing joining the two islands.  Captured from a failing build: that net
    routed to the single tile (80,25,1), and ``_source_for`` fed it from the
    belt at (81,25,1), a tile of the FOUR-machine shard's own path into the same
    lane.  One belt taking items off a lane and handing them straight back:
    adjacent, acyclic, right item, worth nothing.  Both counters read success so
    ``failed`` was 0, the sweep accepted the pack, and eleven machines were left
    drawing 11/4 items/s of titanium-glass from the 16/7 four machines make.

    Replayed on the five packs captured from 96 builds, every one of which
    reported ``flow.conservation`` before and certifies clean after, with
    ``failed`` still 0 -- so the join is now made rather than the pack refused.

    R1 measured `universe-matrix/no-proliferator` (43 strips) scheduling
    `(125, 160, 100, 80, 60)`, with height 160's greedy seed 258 wide, dying at
    the pre-pack seed gate while `_minimum_pack_width` (92) let it through.
    Task 2's strip re-seating (77898a9) changed this cell to 57 strips: its
    tallest candidate height was then 161, not 160.  THE DRAIN-ROW TASK (spec
    §9 R2) MOVES IT AGAIN, and only the height keyed below moves: this cell is
    69 strips now, up from 57, because a flanked strip whose drain has moved out
    past sorter reach is CAPPED AT ONE MACHINE -- `_flank_lane`'s gap belt would
    otherwise cross the south input lanes -- so the one flanked Matrix Lab
    family became 15 one-machine strips of 6x12 where it was 3 of 30x8.  It
    schedules `(166, 130, 104, 83, 62)` unmodified and
    `(130, 104, 83, 154, 62)` with the seed widened, so the tallest height is
    166 and the boundary height it yields to is still 154.  That height's real
    greedy seed is 138 wide, not 258 -- well under the ~200 width where
    `envelope.frame_candidates` starts refusing the tallest height (measured
    directly at 161: empty at width 200, non-empty at width 150).  A corpus-wide scan (every
    ``URL_CORPUS`` entry, every ``CandidatePolicy``, 36 buildable candidates)
    found the fix changes `_band_policy_candidate_heights`'s output for NONE
    of them post-Task-2: this specific defect no longer reproduces live
    anywhere in the corpus, matching the reversion rule's "buys no coverage by
    itself" (R4 §6 E2).

    This restores R1's own measured number (258, the realised outline width its
    greedy seed for this cell's tallest height actually packed) at the one
    height whose seed narrowed under Task 2, holding every other height's real,
    unmodified seed.  That is the minimal patch that makes the historical defect
    observable again: with only `_minimum_pack_width` (64) as witness, height
    166 survives; with `max(_minimum_pack_width, realised_width)` (258) it dies
    at `frame_candidates` and boundary height 154 takes its slot -- R1's §2/§3
    mechanism, on real strips, with one real historical number substituted for
    a value the corpus no longer produces.
